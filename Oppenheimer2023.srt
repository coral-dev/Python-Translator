1
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:46,000
Dr. Oppenheimer.

2
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Dr. Oppenheimer.

3
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:54,000
As we begin, I believe you have a statement to read into the record.

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yes, Your Honor.

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We're not judges, Doctor.

6
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,000
Your Honor.

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Of course.

8
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,000
Who is that the security point?

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The so-called interrogatory information.

10
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,110
in your indictment of me cannot be

11
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,000
fairly understood except in the context of my life and my work.

12
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,000
How long did he testify?

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Honestly, I forget.

14
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,000
The whole hearing took a month.

15
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,000
An hour to know?

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Well, I've only read the transcripts.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I would want to justify their own life.

18
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,000
You weren't there?

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
As chairman, I wasn't allowed to be.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Are they really going to ask about it?

21
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,000
It was years ago.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Four years ago.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I thought.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oppenheimer still divides America.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The committee's going to want to know where he stood.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Senator Thoreau, don't ask me to say not to feel

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
like you're on trial.

28
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,150
No, it's coming out differently just sit down.

29
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:56,000
Really, Mr. Thoreau?

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Exactly.

31
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,000
Admiral Thoreau is a visual.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,050
This is a formality.

33
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,000
President Eisenhower's asked you to be in his cabinet.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Senate really has no choice but to confirm him.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And who should they bring up, Oppenheimer?

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
When they bring up Oppenheimer.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,050
You answer honestly.

38
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,000
No senator can deny.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
He did your duty.

40
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,050
It'll be uncomfortable.

41
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,000
We're going to justify their whole life.

42
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,000
Why don't you leave the United States?

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I wanted to study the new physics.

44
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,720
Was there nowhere here?

45
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:29,000
I thought Berkeley had the leading theoretical physics department.

46
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,000
Yes, one side built it.

47
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,000
First I had to go to Europe.

48
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,000
I went to Cambridge to study under Patrick Blackett.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,120
Well, you're happier there than in America.

50
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,000
Happier?

51
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,000
Yes.

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
No.

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No, I-- I was homesick, emotionally mature, troubled by visions of a human universe.

54
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,000
You've listened to laugh.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Oi, Oppenheimer.

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Have you had any sleep?

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Start again.

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I need to go to the lecture, sir.

59
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,000
Why?

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It smells boring.

61
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,000
I think it's gone.

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,000
All right.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Let's go.

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh, you're not you, Oppenheimer.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You finished Coachman's place.

66
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,000
Quantum physics is not a step forward.

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It is a new way to understand reality.

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Einstein's opened the door.

69
00:03:54,300 --> 00:04:02,000
Now we are peering through,

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
seeing the world inside our

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
world, a world of energy and

72
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,070
paradox that not everyone can accept.

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
All right.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Fields, meet J. Robert Oppenheimer.

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What's the J stand for?

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Nothing.

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You are at my lecture.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You ask the only good question.

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
No one's denying his insight.

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
This is laboratory work that

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
needs a little to be desired.

82
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I heard you gave the same answer.

83
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yes, and you ask the same question.

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Why ask again?

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'd like your answer.

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Did you like it better yesterday?

87
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
A lot.

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You can lift the stone without being

89
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,000
ready for the snake that's revealed.

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Now it seems you're ready.

91
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,290
But you don't enjoy the lab.

92
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,000
So get out of Cambridge with each beaker's and potion's.

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Go somewhere they let you think.

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Got to get born.

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Get to Germany.

96
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,000
Study under Max Born.

97
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Learn the ways of theory.

98
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,000
I'll send word.

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Or more.

100
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:06,000
How's your mathematics?

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Not good enough.

102
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,000
The physicist he wants to be.

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Algebrous-like sheet music.

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The important thing isn't can you read music.

105
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,000
It's can you hear it.

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Can you hear the music, Robert?

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yes, I can.

108
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
As Senator from Wyoming, Admiral Strauss, I'm interested

109
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,000
in your relationship with Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.

110
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,000
You met him in 1947?

111
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,000
Correct.

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You were commissioner of the Atomic Energy Commission?

113
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,000
I was, but I actually met

114
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Robert in my capacity

115
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,000
as board member of the Institute for Advanced Study.

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
At Princeton, after the war, he was

117
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,000
world crowns, the great metaphysics.

118
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,000
And I was determined to get him to run the Institute.

119
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Dr. Oppenheimer, an honor.

120
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,000
Mr. Strauss.

121
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's pronounced Strauss.

122
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Open Hagra, the name of the war you served, and the land of the Jewish.

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm a president of Temple of Manuel in Manhattan.

124
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Strauss is just a sudden pronunciation.

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Anyway, welcome to the Institute.

126
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I think you'll be very happy here.

127
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes, well, if you love the community,

128
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
the procession comes with

129
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
that house for you and your wife

130
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
and your two children.

131
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yes, two.

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm a great admirer of your work.

133
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm very righteous about

134
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
training Mr. Strauss.

135
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm sorry, calling room four o'clock.

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Do you know I'm not trained in physics or

137
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
anything else, and I'm self-prolonged now.

138
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Oh, I can relate to that.

139
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Really?

140
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:28,000
Yes, my father was one.

141
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
This would be your office.

142
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm told he's there most after this.

143
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You know, I've always wondered why you

144
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:37,000
didn't involve him in the Manhattan Project.

145
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Greatest scientific mind of our time.

146
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,000
Of his time.

147
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:48,000
Einstein published his theory of relativity.

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
more than 40 years ago now.

149
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I remember he's quite a moral and revealed.

150
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:05,000
God doesn't play dice.

151
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,000
Precisely.

152
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Never thought of studying physics formally, Mr. Strauss.

153
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I had authors, but I chose to sell shoes.

154
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,000
Louis Strauss was once a lordy shoe salesman.

155
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,000
Not just a shoe salesman.

156
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,000
I'd love to introduce you.

157
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,000
Louis.

158
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I've known him for years.

159
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Albert.

160
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,000
What was that?

161
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What did you say, O?

162
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Well, he's fine.

163
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Mr. Strauss, there are things in my past you'll be aware of.

164
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,000
Well, as chairman of the ADC, I have access to your security file at Red Hood.

165
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You're not worried.

166
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Why would I be worried after everything you've done for your country?

167
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Well, the time has changed, Mr. Strauss.

168
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,000
Well, the purpose of this institute.

169
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
is to provide a haven for independent minds.

170
00:09:50,400 --> 00:10:02,000
That's you.

171
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:09,000
You are the man for the job.

172
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,000
Well, I'm not considering it.

173
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'll see you at the ADC meeting tomorrow.

174
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
This is one of the most prestigious appointments in the country.

175
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,000
Yes.

176
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The great commute.

177
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,000
That's why I'm considering it.

178
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,000
So Dr. Rabinheimer brought your attention

179
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
to his past associations before you appointed him?

180
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,000
Yes.

181
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And they didn't concern you?

182
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,000
But just then, I was entirely consumed

183
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,000
with what he must have said to Einstein to sour him on me.

184
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,200
But later?

185
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,000
Well, we all know what happened later.

186
00:10:47,200 --> 00:11:08,000
Dr. Yura, your time in Europe, you.

187
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
seem to meet with a wide range of other countries' physicists.

188
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:16,000
Yes, that's right.

189
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Any Russians?

190
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Not in this thing to mind.

191
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:28,000
If you'll just allow me to continue with my statement-- Just stay around.

192
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,000
You'll have ample opportunity to cross-exactment.

193
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,000
After getting in, I moved on to

194
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,160
Leiden and Halbens where I first met--

195
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,000
Is it all right?

196
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Hi, Yang.

197
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,000
Lecturing on the new physics.

198
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
This I have to hear.

199
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm an American myself.

200
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,000
Oh, how surprising.

201
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,000
Well, let me know if you need any help with the English.

202
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:59,000
What's he saying?

203
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
No, thank you.

204
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's a long way to Zurich.

205
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
We get every skin here.

206
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,000
We're going to lose you between the sea cushions.

207
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm one of it.

208
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,150
I'm a knight.

209
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,000
I caught your lecture on molecules.

210
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I caught some of it.

211
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
We're a couple of new you'll choose.

212
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,000
How do you know that?

213
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Well, I thought I'd better learn it.

214
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,000
But I got here this semester.

215
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,000
You learned enough Dutch in six weeks to get a lecture on quantum mechanics.

216
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,000
I had to challenge myself.

217
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Quantum physics wasn't challenging enough.

218
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Show off.

219
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,000
Dutch in six weeks, but you never learned yet.

220
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,260
I don't speak it so much my side of the park.

221
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,000
Screw you.

222
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You homesick or you know it.

223
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
If you get the feeling all kind isn't

224
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
entirely welcoming, this is just--

225
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,000
They're all Jewish too.

226
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Eat.

227
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,000
This is German you have to seek out.

228
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Hasbro.

229
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,000
Right.

230
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:16,000
One might be led to the presumption that behind the

231
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,000
quantum world there still hides the real world in which

232
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,000
causality holds, but such speculations seem to us to say explicitly fruitless.

233
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Thank you.

234
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Have a great day.

235
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
What are you thinking?

236
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Dr. Oliver.

237
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Oh my god.

238
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,100
Yes.

239
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,000
I liked your paper and molecules.

240
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,000
Probably because you're inspired.

241
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
If I inspire anything else, let me know.

242
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
We could publish together.

243
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,000
I have to get back to America.

244
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,160
Why?

245
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,000
There's no one there taking quantum mechanics seriously.

246
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,040
That's exactly why.

247
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,000
He's pining for the canyons of Latin.

248
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Canyons of New Mexico.

249
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You're from New Mexico?

250
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
No, New York.

251
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
But my brother and I have a ranch outside Santa Fe.

252
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
That's the America I miss right now.

253
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Then it's best you get home, Cowboys.

254
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Ha ha.

255
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
That's him.

256
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
No, me and horses.

257
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,000
I don't think so.

258
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:31,000
Nice to meet you.

259
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Did you ever encounter Harrison Burke again?

260
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Not in person.

261
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
No, but, uh, you might say our paths crossed.

262
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm returning to America.

263
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I accepted positions at both Caltech and David Burke there.

264
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Dr. Lawrence, I presume?

265
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You must be off when I work.

266
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Yes.

267
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I hear you want to start a

268
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
school of quantum theory.

269
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I am starting it next door.

270
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
They put you in there.

271
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I thought I'd be close to you experimentalists.

272
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Theory will get you only so far.

273
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
We're building a machine to accelerate electrons.

274
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Magnificent.

275
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Would you like to help?

276
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Build it? Oh, no.

277
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,000
Ha ha.

278
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Oh, no.

279
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,000
But I am working on theories I'd like to test with it.

280
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,000
When do you start teaching?

281
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I've got my first in an hour.

282
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Seminar?

283
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Pupil.

284
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,000
One student.

285
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
That's it?

286
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm teaching something no one here is trapped of.

287
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
But once people start hearing what you can do with it, they're still going back.

288
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,000
Oh, I must have just, uh-- Mr. Lomont?

289
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Not.

290
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yeah.

291
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,010
Yes.

292
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,150
This is it.

293
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,270
Please.

294
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,000
Take a seat.

295
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What do you know about

296
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
quantum mechanics?

297
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:25,000
I have a grasp on the basis.

298
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,000
And you're doing it wrong.

299
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Is light made up of particles or waves?

300
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,080
Quantum mechanics is its focus.

301
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,000
How could it be both?

302
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
A.K.

303
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:38,000
A.K.

304
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
A.K.

305
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,000
But it is.

306
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It's paradoxical.

307
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And yet, it works.

308
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Thank you.

309
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,000
Mr. Lomont, it's going to be okay.

310
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Mr. Snyder.

311
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,070
Now, let's consider a star.

312
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,000
A star on a vast furnace burning in outer space.

313
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Fire pushing upwards against its own gravity.

314
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's balanced.

315
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
But if that phrase accrues, then gravity starts winning.

316
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It contracts.

317
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Density increases.

318
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Correct.

319
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Increasing gravity.

320
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,000
Increasing density.

321
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,000
And it's a vicious cycle until... What's the limit here?

322
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I don't know.

323
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
See, when the math takes us, I guarantee it somewhere no one's been before.

324
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Me?

325
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yes, you and your math is better than mine.

326
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Dr. Abenheimer's file contained details and activities in Berkeley.

327
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:24,000
Why would they have started the file on Dr. Abenheimer before the war?

328
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,000
Well, you have

329
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
to ask Mr. Hoover.

330
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm asking you, Admiral Strauss.

331
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Well, my assumption is that he was connected to his left-wing political activities.

332
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You shouldn't have let them write

333
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
their politics in the classroom, Bobby.

334
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I wrote that.

335
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Lawrence, you've increased the revolution in physics.

336
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Can you see it everywhere else?

337
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Picasso, Stravinsky, Froy, Marx... Well, this is America.

338
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
We had our revolution.

339
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Seriously.

340
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:55,000
Keep it out of the lab.

341
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Well, out of the lab, my landlady's having a discussion about tonight.

342
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Interesting.

343
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,000
I have sampled the Berkeley political scene.

344
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's all just philosophy postgrads and communists talking integration.

345
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You don't care about integration.

346
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I want to vote for it, not talk about it.

347
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Especially on Friday.

348
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Come on, let's eat.

349
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm meeting my brother there.

350
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And how would these activities

351
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
occur to the intention of the FBI?

352
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Well, if I remember correctly,

353
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
the FBI was taking

354
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
license plates outside

355
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
of the suspected communist gatherings in the island.

356
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,000
His name popped up.

357
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Jesus Christ.

358
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Sorry.

359
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Frankly, but... I do remember Jackie.

360
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,000
Good night.

361
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Robert, I want you to meet John.

362
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Dr. Hopin Stavallier, Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.

363
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Pleasure.

364
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,000
This is my little brother Frank.

365
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,000
And this is... Still Jackie.

366
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:11,000
Hello, still Jackie.

367
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Stavallier, you're in languages, and your reputation receives you.

368
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,000
What have you heard?

369
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm glad you're teaching a radical new approach to physics.

370
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:21,000
I have no chance of understanding, but I hadn't heard.

371
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You're a party member, but I'm not.

372
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
No, not yet.

373
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:28,000
Frank and I think

374
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,000
you're joining.

375
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I support a range of policies.

376
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's been a civil war,

377
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
a Democratic republic being overthrown by fascist thugs who wouldn't.

378
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,000
A government?

379
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:40,000
They think that socialism is the biggest threat to them fascists.

380
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,000
Not for long.

381
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,000
A bit of other Nazis are due to the Jews.

382
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,020
I send funds to colleagues in Germany to have a greater eye to do something.

383
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,000
My old work is so abstract.

384
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:58,000
What are you working on?

385
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
What happens to stars when they die?

386
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,000
Do the stars die?

387
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Well, if they do, they'd cool and collapse.

388
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:13,000
In fact, the bigger the star, the more violent it's demise.

389
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Their gravity gets so concentrated it swallows everything.

390
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Everything you can like.

391
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Can that really happen?

392
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
The math says it can.

393
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
If we can get published, then perhaps one day an astronomer finds one,

394
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,000
but right now all I have is theory, which can't impact people's lives.

395
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Well, if you're going to send money to Spain, do it through the Communist Party.

396
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,050
They can get it to the front lines.

397
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,000
Sorry, I said you were pleased. I'm Jane.

398
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Robert.

399
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Oh, Conchobelia, you and me in service last month.

400
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,000
Right, right, yes. Thank you.

401
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,000
Robert here says he's not a Communist.

402
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Well, then he doesn't know enough about it.

403
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
The wife does cover down all

404
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,000
three volumes. Does that count?

405
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,000
It would make you better read the most bloody members' church and stuff.

406
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,000
There's some thinking. Ownership is theft.

407
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Property.

408
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Property?

409
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,000
Property, not pollution.

410
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm sorry. I read it in the original German.

411
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Oh.

412
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,000
It's not about the book. It's about the ideas.

413
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,000
And you sound uncommitted.

414
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:12,000
Well, I'm committed to thinking freely about how to improve our world.

415
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Why limit yourself to one, dogma?

416
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You're a physicist. You pick and choose rules.

417
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Or do you use the discipline to channel your energies into progress?

418
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,000
I clean with a room.

419
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:24,000
You always tell the party line.

420
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I like my level room, too.

421
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:32,000
What?

422
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,220
Wait, wait, wait.

423
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:37,000
I expected... What?

424
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,000
For a physicist.

425
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,000
You only have a shelf full of Freud.

426
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,000
Well, I actually have my

427
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,000
backgrounds more... Young Ian?

428
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,000
You know analysis.

429
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
When I was in post-credit Cambridge, I had a little trouble.

430
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,170
How about you?

431
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,000
I tried to poison my tutor.

432
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Did you hate him?

433
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I liked him very much.

434
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,000
You just need to get laid.

435
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Took my analyst two years, and I don't think they ever put it that succinctly.

436
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You have everyone convinced you you're more complicated than you actually are.

437
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,000
You're all simple souls, I guess.

438
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm learning.

439
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,000
What's this?

440
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,000
Sand cream.

441
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:22,000
You can read this.

442
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm learning.

443
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,000
Read this.

444
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:32,000
Well, in this part, fish do let the low system of the arms... You know.

445
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,000
Read the words.

446
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And now I have become dead.

447
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Destroyed off worlds.

448
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,000
This'll do.

449
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,000
A little break before dawn.

450
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Air cools overnight.

451
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:04,000
Just before dawn.

452
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,000
No breaks.

453
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:10,050
So, I'm getting married.

454
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,050
Frank, congratulations.

455
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,000
Thanks, Jackie.

456
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Yeah, to Jackie.

457
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
The waitress?

458
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,000
I'll be your right.

459
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:22,000
He's letting up.

460
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm gonna see him say stars.

461
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,000
All your talk about the common man.

462
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,000
Jackie's not good enough for you.

463
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,000
We join the party, and you can't hide your discipline now.

464
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Why?

465
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,000
Is that because that's supposed to be worth it?

466
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I haven't joined the party, Frank.

467
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,000
And I don't think she should

468
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:51,000
have convinced you to either.

469
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,000
Half of the faculty is gone.

470
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Yeah, that half.

471
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:59,000
I'm your brother, Frank, and I want you to be cautious.

472
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:07,000
And I want to ring your neck.

473
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I won't live my life afraid to make a mistake.

474
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You're happy.

475
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I'm happy.

476
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,000
So, then I'm happy you

477
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
are happy that I'm happy.

478
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
If you look, I can see one of those dark stars that you're working on.

479
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You can't.

480
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:04,000
It's the whole point of gravity swallows light.

481
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
It's like a kind of hole in space.

482
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Is Frank okay?

483
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,000
Yes.

484
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
He just says a shitty brother.

485
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
It is special here.

486
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,050
When I was a kid, I thought

487
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,000
if I could find a way to

488
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,000
combine physics and New Mexico, my life would be perfect.

489
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
A little remote for that?

490
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:23,000
Yes.

491
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Let's get some sleep.

492
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
New Mexico we saw today.

493
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
One of my favorite places in the world.

494
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Tomorrow with climate.

495
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
What's it called?

496
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Los Alamos.

497
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:36,000
I didn't expect to see you today.

498
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I'll have to make an appointment.

499
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,000
Robert?

500
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:46,000
Tommy!

501
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Tommy!

502
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,000
What?

503
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:59,000
What is it?

504
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
They've done it.

505
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
They've done it.

506
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
They split the uranium nucleus.

507
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
How?

508
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,000
I'm worried about neutrons.

509
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:13,000
It's a nuclear fission.

510
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,000
They did it.

511
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:27,000
They split the atom.

512
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,000
Stop my skull.

513
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,000
I'm going to try to reproduce it.

514
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
See?

515
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:35,000
Can't be done.

516
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,000
Very elegant.

517
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Quite clear.

518
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,000
There's just one problem.

519
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,000
Where?

520
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Next door.

521
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:52,000
Alvarez did it.

522
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:55,000
Look.

523
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
These fission pulses, they're massive.

524
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I've seen 30 of these in the past 10 minutes.

525
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Theory will take you only so far.

526
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
During the process,

527
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
external transport office could be used to submit other uranium atoms.

528
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Chain reaction.

529
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You're thinking what I'm thinking.

530
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
You're weird.

531
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,000
Every other physicist around

532
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
the world has seen you.

533
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I'm just wondering,

534
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
what are we all thinking?

535
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
A bomb, Alvarez.

536
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
A bomb.

537
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I told you, Rob, no more fucking flowers.

538
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I don't understand what you want.

539
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,000
I don't want anything from you.

540
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,000
But you say that, and then you call.

541
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Well, don't answer.

542
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I'll always answer.

543
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Fine.

544
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,000
Just no more flowers.

545
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:53,000
They're coming.

546
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,000
You have to know when you're beaten, Robert.

547
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:58,000
It's not that simple, ok?

548
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,000
So, Barlier, good to see you.

549
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,000
We don't have Barbara,

550
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:09,000
good to see you.

551
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And illustrious

552
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,000
Dr. Rottenheimer.

553
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,000
I'm Alton Tippett.

554
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
No.

555
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
What should I please, please?

556
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,000
Can I just say a word about organized labor?

557
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:27,000
Coming through, coming through.

558
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,000
I work at Shell.

559
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:34,000
We sign up chemists,

560
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,000
we sign up engineers.

561
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
There's a bit of a science in that position.

562
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,120
Teachers are unionized. Why not? Professors.

563
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:44,000
Don't you have somewhere to be?

564
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,000
Lawrence, academics of rights too.

565
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Look, it's not that.

566
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I've got a group coming.

567
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:53,000
Oh, let's get in.

568
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Not this one.

569
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
That's it. Dr. Bush. What

570
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,000
brings you two up north?

571
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Richard, you tell Ruth that I'll be down to passing you into Thursday.

572
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,000
April Black Holes, it's in!

573
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:07,000
Where's Harvard?

574
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Get Harvard.

575
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Get Harvard.

576
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
September 1st, 1939. The world's been removing this thing.

577
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Oh, Harlan, our paper, it's in print.

578
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
You've been upstaged.

579
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
During the Battle of Britain, I found myself increasingly out of sympathy

580
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
with the policy of neutrality

581
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
that Communists advocated.

582
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Relator Hitler invaded Russia and we became allies.

583
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
These Communists simply stood their return?

584
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
No.

585
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I need to make clear that

586
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
my changing views on Russia

587
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
did not mean a sharp break from those who held different views.

588
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,000
For a year or two, during a previous marriage,

589
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
my wife Kitty had been a Communist Party member.

590
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
This is right. He's a good stuff.

591
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I love him, Mr. Paulman.

592
00:29:54,250 --> 00:30:02,000
I live with them. I'm a limicantic.

593
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Do you believe anything?

594
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:15,000
Look at Ruthie.

595
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:27,000
So, you're a biologist.

596
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Well, somehow I have graduated to housewife.

597
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Can you explain

598
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
quantum mechanics to me?

599
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
It seems badly.

600
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,000
Yes, it is.

601
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Well, it's glass.

602
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:48,000
It's a drink.

603
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
It's countertop.

604
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Our bodies.

605
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
All of it.

606
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
It's mostly empty space.

607
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:04,000
Groupings of tiny energy waves bound together.

608
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:08,000
Of what?

609
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:10,000
Forces of attraction strong enough to convince us.

610
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
that matter is solid.

611
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,000
It's not my body passing through yours.

612
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:22,000
You're married to Dr. Harrison.

613
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I'm not married.

614
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,000
There is someone that I feel...

615
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
She feels that way.

616
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,000
Sometimes, I don't know.

617
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,000
You know, going to New Mexico,

618
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,000
to my ranch with friends, you should come.

619
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I met with your husband.

620
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,000
Yes, you did.

621
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:43,000
Because you know it won't make a better difference.

622
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Why did you marry him?

623
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:47,000
I was lost.

624
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,000
He was kind.

625
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,400
Lost?

626
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,000
Well, your previous husband had died.

627
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:58,000
At 28, it wasn't really ready to be a widow.

628
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Who's your first husband?

629
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Nobody.

630
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,000
My second husband was Joe Dallad.

631
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
He was from a money like me,

632
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:22,000
but he was a union organizer in Youngstown, Ohio.

633
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
How hard.

634
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,000
How hard?

635
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,000
Hard enough to spend the next four years living off beans and pancakes,

636
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
handing out the Daily Worker back to Regates.

637
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,000
By 36, I just told Joe I couldn't take it anymore.

638
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,000
Quit the party.

639
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,000
Your later on wanted it back.

640
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Him, not the Daily Worker.

641
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:49,000
He sits well and meets you on my way to Spain.

642
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I'm going to the lawless.

643
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And then he went to the Regates and I waited.

644
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:59,000
And...

645
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Joe got himself killed the first time he popped his head out of the trench.

646
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,000
My ideology got Joe killed.

647
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,000
For nothing.

648
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
What's the kind of Republic? Is it nothing?

649
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
My husband offered both our futures to stop one

650
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
fascist bullet from embedding itself in a mud bag.

651
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,000
That's the definition of nothing.

652
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:18,000
This seems a little reductive.

653
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,000
Magnetic.

654
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Now here I am.

655
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:24,000
Who the hell is this?

656
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Not in one unit heard from anyone else.

657
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,000
At least you didn't bring me flowers.

658
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
They're both in a one, not what you want, Jane.

659
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Yeah, but it's the door closing.

660
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
No.

661
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Not as far as I'm concerned, no.

662
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
You knocked her up. Fast work.

663
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Can't keep a good man down.

664
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Yeah.

665
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:47,000
I need her.

666
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,000
She knew what you wanted.

667
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,000
What about the husband?

668
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
We talked. They're getting a divorce.

669
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,890
So we can get married before she starts showing.

670
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,000
I was civilized.

671
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,000
You idiot. This is your community.

672
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,000
You think the rules don't apply to the Golden Boy?

673
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Brilliant specs have been a lot.

674
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Don't alienate the only people in the world that understand what you do.

675
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
One day you might need them.

676
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
F.A.E.D.

677
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:25,000
Federation Department of Dext. Engineers, chemists, technicians.

678
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:35,000
Luminous.

679
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,000
What do you get paid a month?

680
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,000
It's nothing point-wise.

681
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:44,000
What do any of you have in common with farm laborers and dock workers?

682
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Plenty.

683
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,000
Everybody out?

684
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
No!

685
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,000
Not you.

686
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
What are you doing?

687
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
It's a trade union.

688
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
F.A.E.D.

689
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:02,000
F.A.E.D.

690
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,000
We've come in it so long.

691
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,110
I would try to pardon you.

692
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:12,000
They won't let me bring you on with a project because of this shit.

693
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,000
They won't even let me tell you what the project is.

694
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,000
Oh, I know what the project is.

695
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,000
Oh, really?

696
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,000
We've all heard about Einstein and Sitter's letter to

697
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Roosevelt warning him that Germans could make a bomb.

698
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:37,000
And I know what it means for the Nazis to have a bond.

699
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
But I don't?

700
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
It's not your people. They're hurting the camps.

701
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
It's mine.

702
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
You think that I tell them about your politics.

703
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:48,000
The next time you're coming home from a meeting,

704
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
why don't you take a look in the rear view mirror,

705
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,000
listen to the sounds on your phone line and stop being so goddamn naive.

706
00:35:54,150 --> 00:36:02,000
I really care what I do.

707
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Because you're not just self-important. You're actually important.

708
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Okay.

709
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I get it.

710
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
And if you could just be a little bit pragmatic,

711
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,020
I'll talk to the loaners, I'll talk to the others.

712
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:10,000
You don't have to worry. It's done.

713
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,000
Alliance.

714
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Then we'll come to the war.

715
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I filled out my first security questionnaire and was

716
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,100
informed that my involvement with left-wing groups

717
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:20,020
would not prove a lie to my working on the atomic program.

718
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:24,000
Why were his communist associations not

719
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
seen as a security rescue during the war?

720
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,000
Senator, I can't possibly answer for a security

721
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
clearance Grant years before I ever met him.

722
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,000
What? What about now?

723
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,890
After the war, Dr. Oppenheimer was the most respected scientific voice in the world.

724
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,000
That's why I asked him to join the Institute.

725
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:44,000
That's why he advised the Atomic Energy Commission.

726
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,000
So who's that?

727
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,000
Really accusing me of it.

728
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,000
I think they just want to know what happened between 1947 and

729
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
1954 to change your mind on Oppenheimer's security clearance.

730
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,850
I didn't. I was chair of

731
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:02,000
the AEC, but it wasn't

732
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,000
me that brought the charges against Robert.

733
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Who did?

734
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:12,000
I'm a former staff member of the Joint Congressional

735
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,040
Committee. There's a rabid anti-communist named Borton.

736
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:18,000
He wrote to the FBI demanding they take action.

737
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
FBI wouldn't go to the AEC, Rick.

738
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:28,000
And get caught holding the knife yourself.

739
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:30,640
Was it Borton having a son?

740
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:33,000
This was the McCarthy era.

741
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:35,000
People hounded out of jobs

742
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:41,000
for him, and he had to rat him.

743
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,430
Reading Oppenheimer's security file was caught on a

744
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:46,000
minister's brother, sister, and

745
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
the fiancé, best friend, wife.

746
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Before we even get to the ship on the AEC Institute.

747
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:52,760
How would Borton have access to Oppenheimer's security file?

748
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,000
Because somebody gave it to him.

749
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:59,770
Somebody would look at Robert's silence too.

750
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:03,000
Who?

751
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Who knows. Robert didn't take care not to upset the power brokers in Washington.

752
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,440
His opinions on the

753
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,000
atom became definitive.

754
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And he wasn't always patient with us mere mortals.

755
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I came in for plenty of harsh treatment.

756
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:17,000
There was an AEC vote on the export of isotopes to Norway.

757
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And they drafted it, Robert,

758
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,000
to make me look like a fool.

759
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:26,000
But, Dr. Oppenheimer, we've already heard from Admiral Stross that these

760
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,690
isotopes could be useful to our enemies in the production of atomic weapons.

761
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:32,000
Countess Menyuk used a shuttle to make atomic weapons.

762
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:35,000
And what did you do?

763
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
You could use a bottle of beer to make atomic weapons.

764
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
In fact, you knew.

765
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I'd say isotopes are less useful than electronic

766
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
weapons, but more useful than a sandwich.

767
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:50,000
Genius is no guarantee of wisdom.

768
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:53,000
Look at this man who saw so much of me so blind.

769
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:56,000
Kitty?

770
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,000
Kitty?

771
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Kitty?

772
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Roger.

773
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:14,030
I'm in.

774
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:18,000
I'm in.

775
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Let's celebrate.

776
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Shouldn't you go, huh?

777
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I have been calling to him all fucking day.

778
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I don't know how to say this.

779
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,220
I'm ashamed to ask.

780
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:32,000
Anything?

781
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:38,000
Take Peter.

782
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Sure.

783
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I've known for a while, Hulk.

784
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
A while.

785
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:57,000
Does Kitty know you?

786
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Yes, of course she knows.

787
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Of course she knows.

788
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
We're awful people.

789
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Selfish, awful people.

790
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Forget I asked.

791
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Selfish, awful people.

792
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
They don't know.

793
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
They're selfish and awful.

794
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Sit, sit, sit.

795
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Robert, you see beyond the world we live in.

796
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
There is a price to be paid for that.

797
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:20,000
Of course we'll help you.

798
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Everything's changing, Robert.

799
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:49,000
Harry child was always going to change.

800
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
The world is pivoting in some new direction.

801
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,000
Reforming.

802
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,000
This is your moment.

803
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
We're putting together a group to study.

804
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
We should be doing anything.

805
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:00,000
You should.

806
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Lawrence won't get this done.

807
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,000
We're told, Monor Ravi, you will.

808
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Who are the unicorns?

809
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:09,000
I thought you might have them.

810
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,100
Roger, Robert, I'm Colonel Brooks.

811
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,000
This is Lieutenant Colonel Nichols.

812
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Have that drag link.

813
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:17,000
That's how you treat Lieutenant Colonel.

814
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:19,000
I came to see how you treat a humble, this is his son.

815
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,000
If I ever meet one, I'll let you know.

816
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
How much?

817
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:30,000
Theaters of combat all over the world.

818
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
But I have to stay in Washington.

819
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,000
Why?

820
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I built the Pentagon.

821
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Nebraska likes it so much they made me take over the Manhattan Engineer District.

822
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Which is?

823
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:53,000
Whatever.

824
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:57,000
Biggest smartass.

825
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:00,000
You know damn well what it is.

826
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,000
You and half of every physics

827
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
department across the country.

828
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,100
That's problem number one.

829
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:07,000
I thought problem number one would be securing enough uranium ore.

830
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:10,000
1200 tons.

831
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,000
Bought the day I took charge.

832
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:21,000
Processing?

833
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:24,000
Just broke ground at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

834
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:29,000
Now I'm looking for a project director.

835
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,000
And my name came up.

836
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,000
Nope.

837
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Even though you brought quantum

838
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,000
physics to America, which made me curious.

839
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
What have you found out?

840
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
You're a dilettante, a womanizer,

841
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
a suspected communist.

842
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,000
I'm a New Deal Democrat.

843
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I said suspected.

844
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Unstable, theatrical,

845
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:59,000
egotistical, neurotic.

846
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Nothing good.

847
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
No, not even he's brilliant.

848
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
But brilliance is taken for granted in your circle.

849
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,000
So no.

850
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,070
The only person who had anything

851
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,000
good to say was Richard Tolman.

852
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:11,000
Tolman thinks you have integrity.

853
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
But he also strikes me as a guy who knows more about science than people.

854
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:14,000
And here you are.

855
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
You don't take much of trust.

856
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:18,000
I don't take anything on trust.

857
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,000
Why don't you have a Nobel Prize?

858
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Why aren't you a general?

859
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:24,000
They're making me one for this.

860
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:28,000
Perhaps I'll have the same luck.

861
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:30,000
A Nobel Prize for making a bomb?

862
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I'll put a Nobel in meant a dynamite.

863
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,000
So how would you proceed?

864
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
You're talking about

865
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:42,000
turning theory into a

866
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:43,000
practical weapon system faster than the Nazis.

867
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
We have a 12-month head start.

868
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
18.

869
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
How could you possibly know that?

870
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,060
Our fast neutron research took six months.

871
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,000
The man they want doubted to put in charge would have made that leap instantly.

872
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:58,000
Who do you think they put in charge?

873
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,200
Bernard Heisenberg.

874
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:02,000
He is the most intuitive understanding of atomic structure I have ever seen.

875
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
You know his work.

876
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:10,000
I know him just

877
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
like I know Walter.

878
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Both of us, Isaac and Diebner, in

879
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
his straight race, the Germans win.

880
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
We've got one hope, which is... anti-Semitism.

881
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
What Hitler called quantum physics Jewish science, right to Einstein's face,

882
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,200
our one hope is that Hitler is so blinded by

883
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:26,030
hate that he's denied Heisenberg proper resources

884
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,000
because it'll take vast resources.

885
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:32,000
Our nation's best scientists working together right now,

886
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
they're scattered, which gives us compartmentalization.

887
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
All minds have to see the

888
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
whole task to contribute efficiently.

889
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Poor security may, cause us the race inefficiency, will.

890
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
The Germans know more than us anyway.

891
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
The Russians don't.

892
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,000
Remind me, who are we at war with?

893
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Somebody with your past doesn't want to be seen downplaying

894
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
the importance of security

895
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
from our communist allies.

896
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:56,000
We're taking, but no.

897
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:03,000
You don't get to say no to me.

898
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,350
My job say no to you and you're wrong.

899
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,000
So you have the job now?

900
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:10,000
I'm considering it.

901
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,020
I'm starting to see where you got your reputation.

902
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:15,000
My favorite response, Oppenheimer couldn't run a hamburger stand.

903
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:18,000
I couldn't.

904
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
But I can run the

905
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,480
Manhattan Project.

906
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:26,000
Just a way to balance those things.

907
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:30,000
Keep the right lab here in Berkeley under Lawrence.

908
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,670
Met lab in Chicago under some of the large scale of finding wordages in Tennessee.

909
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,000
And Hanford.

910
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And Hanford.

911
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:42,000
All Americas, industrial, mining,

912
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:45,000
scientific innovation, connected

913
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,000
by a rail, focused on one goal, one point in space and time.

914
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:49,000
And it comes together here.

915
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,000
A secret laboratory in the middle of nowhere.

916
00:45:55,470 --> 00:46:00,000
Secure, self-sufficient, equipment housing works.

917
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:03,000
Keep everyone there until it's done.

918
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:07,000
They'll need a school, a store, or a church.

919
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:10,000
Why?

920
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:14,000
If we don't let scientists bring their families, we'll never get the best.

921
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,000
And you want security built in town?

922
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Build it fast.

923
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Where?

924
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,170
Welcome to Los Alamos.

925
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:29,000
There's a boy school that will have two of the common

926
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
gear and the local Indians can prepare for buried rights.

927
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
But from that, nothing.

928
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
40 miles in any direction.

929
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I have to find the perfect spot for success.

930
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Build the town fast.

931
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Let's go recruit some scientists.

932
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Why would I need my family?

933
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I told you, you can bring your family.

934
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I'm not a soldier.

935
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I'm a soldier.

936
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
This is general.

937
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I've got all the soldier I need.

938
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,910
What can I tell?

939
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,000
How's it looking?

940
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Didn't you?

941
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Both of them bored.

942
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
What do these men have in common?

943
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
The greatest minds on atomic theory.

944
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Do you understand?

945
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
As much as you like.

946
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Do you feel my food on your balls, sir?

947
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
You know isotopes and you know explosives better than anyone in the world.

948
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
But you can't tell us what you're doing.

949
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I don't know Nazis to have them.

950
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
The news boys in Copenhagen under Nazi occupation.

951
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Did they stop printing newspapers in Princeton?

952
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Why would we go to the middle of nowhere for who knows how long?

953
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
For a year or two or three.

954
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Imagine the country.

955
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Give us a moment.

956
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
It's about unleashing the strong force.

957
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Before the Nazis don't.

958
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
My God.

959
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
The hills won't work for the Nazis.

960
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
No, never.

961
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
They have them.

962
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
We don't.

963
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:53,000
That's why I need you.

964
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Why would you think I'd do that?

965
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Why?

966
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Why?

967
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
How about because this is the most important fucking

968
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
thing that ever happened

969
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
in the history of the world?

970
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
How about that?

971
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I don't think I'd.

972
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I don't think I'd.

973
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
They're not going to let me out of this project.

974
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
And failing a security check is not going to be good for a career even after the war.

975
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
So you're a fellow traveler.

976
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Someone.

977
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
This is a national emergency.

978
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I've got some skeletons.

979
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
They put me in charge.

980
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
They need us.

981
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,960
Until they don't.

982
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:30,000
Is there any chance of getting bored out of Denmark?

983
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Yeah, no dice.

984
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I checked with the British.

985
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Until we get Allied boots back onto the continent, there's just no way.

986
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Is he that important?

987
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:45,000
How many people do you know of true dance time, Paul?

988
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
It really would be

989
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
quicker to take a plane.

990
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
No, a plane's too risky.

991
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
The country needs us.

992
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Papa, guys, this ain't a building.

993
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,000
This is all for the cyclotron.

994
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Count together the architects.

995
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:01,000
When's this place supposed to open?

996
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Two months.

997
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,000
Robin, you're the great improviser, but this... it can't do in your head.

998
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Four emissions.

999
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,000
Experimental.

1000
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:15,000
Theoretical.

1001
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:17,020
Memoir journal.

1002
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:19,000
Overrunning theoretical.

1003
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I am?

1004
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:26,000
That's what I was afraid of.

1005
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
You spread too thin.

1006
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
So you take theoretical.

1007
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:37,000
I'm not coming here, Robin.

1008
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:41,000
Why not?

1009
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:48,000
You drop a bomb and it falls on the just and the unjust.

1010
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:51,000
I don't wish the culmination of three centuries

1011
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
of physics to be a weapon of mass destruction.

1012
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Is he?

1013
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,000
I don't know if we can be trusted with such a weapon.

1014
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
But I know the Nazis can't.

1015
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
We have no choice.

1016
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
The second thing you have to do is appoint

1017
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:01,000
Holmes Bethe to run the theoretical division.

1018
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:04,000
Ray, what was the first... Take off that ridiculous uniform.

1019
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:09,000
You're a scientist.

1020
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Groves is insisting we join.

1021
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:27,000
Tell Groves to go shit in his hat.

1022
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:30,540
They need us for who we are.

1023
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:33,000
So be yourself.

1024
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:44,000
And the better.

1025
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:49,000
This is the only key.

1026
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:53,000
And tellers are already here.

1027
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,000
Can I just show him in?

1028
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,740
No, let's wait for the others.

1029
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:09,000
Let's get started.

1030
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:15,000
On the right.

1031
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Yes, gentlemen.

1032
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
So we will work here until the

1033
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
T-section at Los Alamos is finished.

1034
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Edward, can I?

1035
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,000
It is more important.

1036
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,000
Can I calculate the chain reaction?

1037
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I found a rather troubling possibility.

1038
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:05,000
No, but this can't be a lie.

1039
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Show me how you did your population.

1040
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Yes.

1041
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
This is fantasy.

1042
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Tellers calculations can't be right.

1043
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Do you know, sir,

1044
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
what I got at Princeton?

1045
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
What for?

1046
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:30,000
I talked to Einstein.

1047
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Well, there's not much comment on the truth at all.

1048
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
That's why I should get his view.

1049
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:36,000
Albert.

1050
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:39,000
No, Dr. Albert Heidman.

1051
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:42,000
How have you met Dr. Gert?

1052
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
We walk here most days.

1053
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Things are the most inspiring structures.

1054
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Albert, I have a word.

1055
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:57,000
No, of course.

1056
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Just read.

1057
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,000
Some days, he refuses to read.

1058
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Even in Princeton, he's convinced that the Nazis can poison his food.

1059
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Whose world is this?

1060
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:06,210
Tellers.

1061
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:08,000
What do you take it to mean?

1062
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Entrance, smash into nucleus, release me.

1063
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,000
Entrance, smash into other nuclei.

1064
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:18,000
Criticality, what do no return massive explosive force can do?

1065
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,000
It's time the chain reaction doesn't stop.

1066
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
It would ignite the atmosphere.

1067
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
We detonate an atomic

1068
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:28,000
device, we might start

1069
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:30,000
a chain reaction that destroys the world.

1070
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
So here we are, huh?

1071
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:35,000
Lost in your quantum world of

1072
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:40,000
probabilities and leading certainty.

1073
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:51,000
Can you run the calculations yourself?

1074
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:54,000
No.

1075
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:56,000
About the only thing you and I have in common is a disdain for mathematics.

1076
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:59,000
Who's working on this in Berkeley?

1077
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Hans Beidman.

1078
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Well, you'll get to the truth.

1079
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
And if the truth is catastrophic?

1080
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Then you stop and you share your findings with the Nazis.

1081
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
So neither side

1082
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,130
destroys the world.

1083
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:24,000
Albert,

1084
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
this is yours, not mine.

1085
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Tellers home,

1086
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:34,000
he's home.

1087
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
When you now tell us critical assumptions, there are any picture emerges.

1088
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:40,000
Outline.

1089
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Chances are not before nuclear reaction are near zero.

1090
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Near zero?

1091
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Oh, this is good news.

1092
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Can you run them again?

1093
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
No, you'll get the same answer.

1094
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Until we actually detonate

1095
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:03,000
one of these things,

1096
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,000
the best assurance

1097
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:21,000
you're going to get is this.

1098
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:23,000
Near zero.

1099
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:36,000
The area will take you only so far.

1100
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,000
Hello.

1101
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:41,000
Hello.

1102
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,000
We missed him.

1103
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:47,000
You want to adopt?

1104
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
She's kidding.

1105
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:50,090
We wanted to see you.

1106
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,370
What we left.

1107
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:54,070
For parts unknown.

1108
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:58,000
You know who I ran into the other day?

1109
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:02,000
Eltonton.

1110
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Oh, McAllister Michelle.

1111
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Are you a new guy?

1112
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Yeah, the F.A.A.C.T guy.

1113
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
He was moaning about how we're handling the war.

1114
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Also, lack of cooperation

1115
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
with our allies.

1116
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,200
Apparently, the government's not sharing any research with the Russians.

1117
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:13,000
He said most scientists think the policy is stupid.

1118
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:15,000
Yeah.

1119
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:17,000
Yeah.

1120
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
He mentioned that if anyone had

1121
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,000
anything they wanted to pass on,

1122
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
going around official channels, that he could help.

1123
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:27,000
There would be treason.

1124
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:32,000
Yes, of course.

1125
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:37,000
I just thought you should know.

1126
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:41,000
The bra is down.

1127
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
We're at the martinis.

1128
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Coming right up.

1129
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:51,000
Conversation entered there.

1130
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:56,000
Nothing in our long-standing friendship would have led me to believe.

1131
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:03,000
that Chevelia was actually

1132
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:06,000
seeking information,

1133
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:08,000
and I am certain that he had no idea of the work in which I was engaged.

1134
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:11,000
It has long been clear to me that I should have reported this incident at once.

1135
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,000
The Oppenheimer situation highlights the tension between scientists

1136
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:16,000
and security apparatus in

1137
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:22,000
hopes of learning how the

1138
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:24,000
nominee handles such issues

1139
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
during his time in the ABC.

1140
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,000
We'll have a scientist appearing before the committee.

1141
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:35,000
They're bringing them.

1142
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:44,000
They haven't said?

1143
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Mr. Chairman, if I may, I'm nominated for Commerce Secretary.

1144
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Why?

1145
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
To seek the opinion of scientists.

1146
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,000
This is a cabinet post-table.

1147
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
We seek a wide range of opinions.

1148
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I'd like to know the name of the scientists testifying.

1149
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:05,000
I'd like the chance to cross-examine.

1150
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
This is not a court.

1151
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:08,000
Formality, huh?

1152
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:10,000
No presidential cabinet nominee has failed to be confirmed since 1925.

1153
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
This is just how the game is played.

1154
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,120
It's in the bag, Lewis. So play nice.

1155
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:17,000
They're bringing the scientists or what?

1156
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:20,000
You don't know scientists like I do, Counselor.

1157
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
They resent anyone of questions that

1158
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
have judgement, especially for all of them.

1159
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:27,000
I was chaired at the ABC.

1160
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:30,000
I'm easy to blame for what happened wrong.

1161
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:32,350
But we can't have the Senate

1162
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,630
taking the scientific community.

1163
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:38,000
It doesn't support you, sir.

1164
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Or should we have that?

1165
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,000
So what?

1166
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
An invasive.

1167
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I fought Oppenheimer in the U.S. one.

1168
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I don't think we need to go there.

1169
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Isn't there someone we can call who knows what really happened?

1170
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:51,000
Tell her.

1171
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,000
They'll make an impression.

1172
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Can you get the name of the scientists they've called?

1173
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,000
Probably.

1174
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Find out if he was based in Chicago or Los Alamos during the war.

1175
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Why does that matter?

1176
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Well, if he was based in Chicago, they worked on their

1177
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
silver to confirm he had not the cult of obvious.

1178
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Los Alamos.

1179
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Robert built that damn place. He was founder of air sheriff.

1180
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,080
Honored him to one.

1181
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:10,000
Oh, that means it's a salute.

1182
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
There's no kitchen.

1183
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:15,000
Billy.

1184
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:17,000
What was that?

1185
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:29,000
Barbed wire.

1186
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Guns.

1187
00:59:31,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Okay.

1188
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Burned war, Hans.

1189
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Halifax.

1190
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,000
1917.

1191
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Carver ship carrying munitions explodes in the harbor.

1192
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
A vast and sudden chemical reaction.

1193
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
The biggest man-made explosion in history.

1194
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Now let's calculate how

1195
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,000
much more destructive it would

1196
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
have been if it were a nuclear and not a chemical reaction.

1197
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Expressing power in terms of tons of TNT.

1198
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
But it would be Salsas.

1199
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Well then, kill all the tons.

1200
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Using U-235, the bomb will need a...

1201
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Sorry.

1202
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Gadget will need a 33-pound sphere about this size.

1203
01:00:39,150 --> 01:00:41,930
Or using plutonium, the 10-pound sphere.

1204
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:45,000
Here's the amount of uranium Oakwood's refined all of last month.

1205
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,000
And the Hanford plan made this month with Antonio.

1206
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Now, we can enrich these amounts. We need a way to detonate them.

1207
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:53,000
Are we boring him, Edward?

1208
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,000
A little bit, yes.

1209
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:03,000
I asked why.

1210
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,000
We all entered this through knowing efficient bomb was possible.

1211
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
How about we leave it with something new?

1212
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Such as?

1213
01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:17,000
Instead of uranium or plutonium, we use hydrogen.

1214
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:21,000
Heavy hydrogen.

1215
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:24,000
Deuterium. You see, we compact the arms together

1216
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:26,000
under great pressure to induce a fusion reaction.

1217
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:31,000
And we'll get not kilotons, but megatons.

1218
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:33,000
Okay, hang on, hang on.

1219
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:35,000
So how do you generate enough force to fuse hydrogen atoms?

1220
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
A small fish of gold.

1221
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:40,000
Well, since we're going to need one anyway, we get back to business at hand.

1222
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,000
The isotopes issue wasn't your most important

1223
01:01:42,550 --> 01:01:44,000
policy disagreement with Dr. Abenheimer.

1224
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,000
It was the hydrogen bomb, wasn't it?

1225
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:50,000
Colleagues, we agreed to

1226
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:54,070
disagree and agreed many things.

1227
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:58,000
And one of them was the need for a H-bond program.

1228
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:03,000
Yes.

1229
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:05,000
Banks, convenient and short notice. I can't believe it.

1230
01:02:05,650 --> 01:02:10,000
I know we are. Catch me up.

1231
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:12,000
What do we know?

1232
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:15,000
One of our B-29s over in the north of the Pacific has detected radiation.

1233
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Do we have the filter papers?

1234
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,690
There's no doubt about what this is.

1235
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:26,000
White House officers are down.

1236
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Wishful thinking, I'm afraid.

1237
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:33,000
Are those the long-range detection filter papers?

1238
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,000
It's an atomic test.

1239
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
The Russians have a bomb. We're supposed to be years ahead of them, but...

1240
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:44,000
What were you guys doing in Los Alamos with the security tank?

1241
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Of course it was. You weren't there.

1242
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Forgive me, Doctor.

1243
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,000
But I was there.

1244
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
We can now consider the actual mechanics of detonation.

1245
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Any ideas?

1246
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,000
I call this shooting. Fire a

1247
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:07,120
chunk of fissionable material

1248
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,000
into a larger sphere with enough force to achieve criticality.

1249
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,160
What do we think? Anyone?

1250
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:13,000
I've been thinking about implosion. Explosives around

1251
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:15,000
the sphere blast inwards, crushing the material.

1252
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:18,000
I'd like to investigate that idea.

1253
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:23,000
I'll talk to Ordnance. Okay, you blow things up.

1254
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Progress.

1255
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:29,000
Nice to see you too.

1256
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Meet the British contingent.

1257
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,000
It's Oppenheimer.

1258
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:38,000
How about Suks?

1259
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
How long have you been British?

1260
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:43,010
Since Hitler told me I wasn't German.

1261
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:47,000
Ah. Got a Mark in Los Alamos.

1262
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Suppose I'm running?

1263
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:51,680
Far? Always running.

1264
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:54,000
And that's a lot of ways we do support the staff.

1265
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Is that Mr. Silver?

1266
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:59,000
Yes. I've offered jobs to all the lives of men, librarians, for computation.

1267
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:01,000
We cut down on staff, keep families together.

1268
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Are these women qualified?

1269
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:05,000
Don't be absurd. These

1270
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
are some of the brightest minds in our community.

1271
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
And they're already

1272
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
security, cleared.

1273
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:14,000
I've informed General Grills you're going to hold in

1274
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
cross-deficient local

1275
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:19,000
discussions on a nightly basis.

1276
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Shut them down. Compartmentalization is the key to maintaining security.

1277
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Only top men. Who presumably communicate with subordinates?

1278
01:04:24,070 --> 01:04:28,000
These men aren't stupid. They can be discreet.

1279
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:30,000
I don't like it. You don't like anything enough for that to be a fair test.

1280
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,980
Once a week. Top men only.

1281
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
We'd like to bring my brother here. No.

1282
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I'm Nicholas.

1283
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:38,080
I still have the nerve that my security clearance has been approved.

1284
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:40,070
It has, and... Go to Chicago tomorrow.

1285
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:44,000
No, you should wait.

1286
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
You are aware that the Nazis have a two-year head start.

1287
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Doctor Albinheimer, the fact that your security

1288
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,000
clearance is proving difficult

1289
01:04:55,850 --> 01:05:01,000
to obtain is not my fault.

1290
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:04,000
It's yours.

1291
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
It may not be your fault,

1292
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:10,070
but it's your problem.

1293
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:12,000
Because I'm going.

1294
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:14,000
And how many people were in these, uh... open... discussions?

1295
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,240
Too many compartmentalizations were supposed to be the protocol.

1296
01:05:16,550 --> 01:05:18,540
You're in the race against the Nazis.

1297
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:21,000
No, the race is against the Soviets.

1298
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Not unless we started.

1299
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Robert, they just

1300
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,000
fired the starting gun.

1301
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,000
What's the nature of the price of their detonators?

1302
01:05:30,450 --> 01:05:33,000
Like the one you built at Los Alamos.

1303
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
The Russians have a bomb. Truman needs to know what's next.

1304
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,000
What's next?

1305
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Arms talks. Arms talks.

1306
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Obviously.

1307
01:05:42,050 --> 01:05:44,090
What other super does Truman even know about it? Do we prefam on that?

1308
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:48,000
Not specifically.

1309
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:51,000
We still don't know if

1310
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
it had a hydrogen ops.

1311
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Technically feasible.

1312
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,000
Right. My understanding is that the teller proposed it.

1313
01:05:57,050 --> 01:05:58,050
Yes.

1314
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:03,000
Tellers designs have always been wildly

1315
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,000
impractical. You'd have to deliver by ox cart.

1316
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Not airplane.

1317
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Not me.

1318
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Sir, Doctor Albinheimer.

1319
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Coming?

1320
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,820
No.

1321
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:15,000
Because if it can put us ahead again, the President

1322
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:17,000
of the United States needs to know about it.

1323
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:18,000
And if the Russians know about it already from

1324
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
a spy at Los Alamos, then we gotta get going.

1325
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
There's no proof there was a spy at Los Alamos.

1326
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Robert.

1327
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:28,790
Put it under the football stadium.

1328
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:32,000
It feels no use in the morning.

1329
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:36,180
Just as well.

1330
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:40,000
Poppy, time to firmie.

1331
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
What was that?

1332
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
My wedding.

1333
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Are you, you got a little town?

1334
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Yes. I'm at sea.

1335
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
How could things trade in a place like that? Huh?

1336
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Everybody will go crazy.

1337
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Thank you for the thought

1338
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
of confidence, Soled.

1339
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Do we really, do we really think that on the nose?

1340
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Are you gonna try it out?

1341
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
We did.

1342
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Diverse, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction.

1343
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Any groups tell you?

1344
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:14,000
Doctor Albinheimer?

1345
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:18,000
I tried personnel.

1346
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
I asked if I would type.

1347
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Can you?

1348
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:26,000
Harvard forgot to teach that on the graduate chemistry course.

1349
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
London, put us a sword here.

1350
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:39,000
What the hell are you doing in Chicago?

1351
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Visiting the men.

1352
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Why?

1353
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
You can't do it.

1354
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Why?

1355
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
We have every right.

1356
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:59,000
You have just the rights that I give you.

1357
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
No more, no less.

1358
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
We are adults trying to run a project here.

1359
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
This is ridiculous.

1360
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Tell him.

1361
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Compartmentalization is the protocol we agreed to.

1362
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Enough of this mad-ass where nobody can work under these conditions.

1363
01:08:06,350 --> 01:08:08,000
You know what?

1364
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:10,070
General Lee Simo, I quit.

1365
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:11,150
Thanks for nothing.

1366
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:13,100
Better off without him.

1367
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:17,000
Aren't you more concerned about his discretion out there?

1368
01:08:18,450 --> 01:08:21,000
We'll have him killed.

1369
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
I'm just kidding.

1370
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
It's me, not America.

1371
01:08:25,070 --> 01:08:27,000
You know General, not everyone has levers to pull like mine.

1372
01:08:29,850 --> 01:08:31,000
I don't think I understand.

1373
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:35,000
You didn't hire me despite my left wind past.

1374
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
You hired me because of it.

1375
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:41,000
So you could control me.

1376
01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:43,000
No, I'm not that subtle.

1377
01:08:43,070 --> 01:08:47,000
I'm just a humble soldier.

1378
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,080
You're neither humble nor just a soldier.

1379
01:08:49,650 --> 01:08:51,000
You studied engineering at MIT.

1380
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Guilty as charged.

1381
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Well now we understand each other.

1382
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Perhaps you can get me my security clearance so I can perform this miracle for you.

1383
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
General Groves, were you aware of Dr. Oppenheimer's

1384
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,000
left wing association is when you appointed him?

1385
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
I was aware that there were suspicions about him.

1386
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
I was aware he had a very extreme liberal background.

1387
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:07,000
In your opinion, would he ever consciously commit a disloyal act?

1388
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,320
I would be amazed if he did.

1389
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,440
He had complete confidence in his integrity.

1390
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:20,400
That was Alamos.

1391
01:09:20,470 --> 01:09:23,000
Yes, which is where I really knew him.

1392
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,000
General, your security

1393
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,000
officers on the project

1394
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
advised you against the clearance of Dr. Oppenheimer.

1395
01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:34,000
They could not and would not clear him until I insisted.

1396
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
And it's safe to say that you had pretty good

1397
01:09:35,350 --> 01:09:37,000
knowledge of Dr. Oppenheimer's security file.

1398
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:39,470
I didn't.

1399
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:42,000
Well, there's only really one question I answered here today.

1400
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:46,000
In light of the current AEC guidelines, would you clear Dr. Oppenheimer today?

1401
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:48,080
Do you have the guidelines?

1402
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:50,000
Under current AEC guidelines, would

1403
01:09:50,050 --> 01:09:51,050
you clear Dr. Oppenheimer today?

1404
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:54,090
Physics and New Mexico, huh?

1405
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:58,000
My God.

1406
01:09:58,050 --> 01:10:00,000
What a trick.

1407
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:13,000
That's why you need a liaison.

1408
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:27,000
I'm appointing Lominance.

1409
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,000
You're gonna be okay.

1410
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
This way, gentlemen.

1411
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Got two hearts.

1412
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Ms. Lee, I'd like to remind you what we talked about in Berkeley.

1413
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Departmentalization, I understand completely.

1414
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
I am here to update you on our progress and solicit your input.

1415
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:49,000
To do so, I am going to have to share a few things that General Groves told me not to.

1416
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Sorry, General, I said I understood.

1417
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Not that I agreed.

1418
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Okay, gentlemen, business.

1419
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,000
There were rumors of espionage,

1420
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:19,000
unsubstantiated Los Alamos.

1421
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:21,000
I'm told that there were communists on the project, knowingly involved.

1422
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
I just want to know were any of them involved in discussions with the super?

1423
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,000
I seem to remember you demanding your brother come to Los Alamos.

1424
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:30,000
My brother had left the party by then.

1425
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:34,000
What about Lominance?

1426
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Lominance was never employed at Los Alamos.

1427
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:41,000
He was a liaison.

1428
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Our security was tight as former Colonel Nichols well known.

1429
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Our security was as

1430
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
tight as it could be, given

1431
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
the personalities involved, but attempts were made.

1432
01:11:47,050 --> 01:11:49,000
What is that supposed to mean?

1433
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
We've all read his file here.

1434
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Do we need to talk about Gene Tatlock?

1435
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:55,000
Or the Chevalier incident?

1436
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Excuse me.

1437
01:11:57,700 --> 01:12:00,000
One minute. Only one.

1438
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:03,000
Hello, Rusty.

1439
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:09,000
What?

1440
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:11,000
Okay, just calm down.

1441
01:12:11,070 --> 01:12:13,000
Lominance just got drafted.

1442
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:21,000
We are at war, Doctor.

1443
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Don't be an asshole,

1444
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:24,000
Nichols. We need this kid.

1445
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Fix it, will you?

1446
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
It wasn't a mistake. Your friend Lominance

1447
01:12:29,450 --> 01:12:31,000
has been trying to unionize the radiation lab.

1448
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
You promised to quit all that.

1449
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:34,960
Well, he hasn't.

1450
01:12:34,970 --> 01:12:37,000
Security officer at

1451
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:39,000
Berkeley is concerned about

1452
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
communist infiltration through that union to F.A.

1453
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,430
F.A.C.D.

1454
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,000
Well, I'm there next

1455
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
week. I'll drop in to see him.

1456
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:54,000
Your cue clearance came through.

1457
01:12:54,850 --> 01:12:58,000
It's important you not maintain or renew any questionable associations.

1458
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:05,000
Doctor, did you think social contacts between a person

1459
01:13:09,870 --> 01:13:12,890
engaged on secret war work and communist was dangerous?

1460
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:16,000
My awareness of the danger would be greater today.

1461
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:20,000
It's fair to say that during the war years, you

1462
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:23,000
felt that such contacts were potentially dangerous.

1463
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:26,000
We're conceivably dangerous, huh?

1464
01:13:26,150 --> 01:13:35,000
Really?

1465
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:37,000
No one communists.

1466
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:39,000
Look.

1467
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,000
I've had a lot of secrets in my head for a long time.

1468
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:48,000
Doesn't matter who I associate with. I don't talk about those secrets.

1469
01:13:49,450 --> 01:13:54,000
You said in your statement that you had to see Gene Tatlock in 1943.

1470
01:13:55,250 --> 01:14:09,000
He left.

1471
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,000
Not a word. What did you think that would do to me?

1472
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:17,000
I wrote.

1473
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Pages of nothing.

1474
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:21,000
Where did you go?

1475
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:26,000
I can't tell you.

1476
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Why not?

1477
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Because you're a communist.

1478
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,000
What did you have to see her?

1479
01:14:33,450 --> 01:14:35,000
She had indicated a great desire to see me before we left.

1480
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:40,000
At that time I couldn't, but I felt that she had to see me.

1481
01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:44,000
She was undergoing psychiatric treatment. She was extremely unhappy.

1482
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:49,000
Did you find out why she had to see you?

1483
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:52,000
She was sitting there with me.

1484
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:59,000
You spent the night together, didn't you?

1485
01:14:59,450 --> 01:15:09,000
Yes.

1486
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,000
You drop in and out of my life, and you don't have to tell me why.

1487
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:28,000
And that's power.

1488
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Not that I enjoy.

1489
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:32,000
I'd rather be here for you as you need.

1490
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:35,010
But you have other priorities now.

1491
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:38,310
I have a wife and child.

1492
01:15:39,550 --> 01:15:41,000
That's not what either of us is talking about.

1493
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,000
Gene, you asked me to come.

1494
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:52,030
And I'm glad I did.

1495
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:55,000
But I can't see you again.

1496
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,000
But what if I need you?

1497
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:02,000
You said you would always answer.

1498
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Is that a word?

1499
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:12,300
Did you think that consistent with insecurity? As a matter of fact it was.

1500
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:17,000
Not a word.

1501
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:19,000
Well, did you see her after that?

1502
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,000
I never saw her again.

1503
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Mm-hmm.

1504
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
I can make the last

1505
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:41,000
train back to Princeton.

1506
01:16:41,450 --> 01:16:44,000
I didn't say anything that I had already told you.

1507
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
The day you said it to history, didn't you?

1508
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,000
So close to you.

1509
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,000
If they don't, we'll use the transcript and show you will.

1510
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:53,000
I'll send her off.

1511
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Well, are you wondering after me when you left to see Gene?

1512
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,000
No, you... You sit there.

1513
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:05,000
Day after day, letting them pick our lives to pieces.

1514
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Why won't you fight?

1515
01:17:11,950 --> 01:17:16,000
Father, I'm not putting her out there.

1516
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:24,000
Dr. Rama, it's an art. Please take a seat.

1517
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:27,180
Maybe, um, I just wanted to check whether I should talk to

1518
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:30,000
you in more minutes while I'm here, given your concerns.

1519
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:33,000
I'd say that's really up to you, Professor, but I'd be cautious.

1520
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Understood.

1521
01:17:34,350 --> 01:17:37,160
Oh, and, um, as regards to Union, I wanted to

1522
01:17:37,170 --> 01:17:40,000
give you a heads up and a man named Eltonton.

1523
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:41,100
A heads up?

1524
01:17:41,650 --> 01:17:45,000
Yes, just that he might be watching his own.

1525
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:48,010
I'd love to get more details.

1526
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:51,020
I have a point, but now and I'd leave early tomorrow.

1527
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:55,000
I'll come back as early as you

1528
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:57,000
like. Since you have the time now.

1529
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
You went back the next morning.

1530
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
I did, I had to.

1531
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,280
Really?

1532
01:18:03,550 --> 01:18:05,000
This time there was another man.

1533
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
He said his name was Pash.

1534
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Pash.

1535
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:13,000
You met Colonel Pash.

1536
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:16,790
Colonel Pash, would you please read from your memo dated June 29, 1943?

1537
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:20,000
Results of surveillance conducted on subject indicate

1538
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,870
further possible Communist Party connections.

1539
01:18:22,890 --> 01:18:26,000
Subject met with and spent considerable time with one

1540
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
gene, Tatlock, Communist, the record of whom is attached.

1541
01:18:28,150 --> 01:18:29,000
The subject being Dr. Raupmanhunde.

1542
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Yes.

1543
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Whom you had not met.

1544
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:35,000
Not that, but soon after.

1545
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
He's the head of security for the project, shouldn't I know him?

1546
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:39,000
No, he should know you.

1547
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
I would never put you in a room with Pash.

1548
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:44,720
Why not?

1549
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:49,000
When Pash first heard about luminance, he told the FBI he was gonna kidnap

1550
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,410
him, take him out on a boat, and interrogate him in the Russian manner.

1551
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:57,000
General Groves has placed in me a certain responsibility,

1552
01:18:58,050 --> 01:19:00,000
and it's like having a child, and I can't see.

1553
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,000
I have remote control.

1554
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
So, we actually need you.

1555
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:08,000
I won't take up too much of your time.

1556
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:10,470
No, no, no. I will tell you the truth.

1557
01:19:10,490 --> 01:19:12,070
Mr. Johnson told me the conversation you

1558
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:14,000
had yesterday, in which I'm very interested.

1559
01:19:14,650 --> 01:19:18,000
He said he worried all day.

1560
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:21,570
Yes, I didn't want to talk to luminance without authorization.

1561
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:25,000
That's not the particular

1562
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:29,080
interest that I had, but it's

1563
01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:33,000
something a little bit more, uh, my opinion more serious.

1564
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:37,000
Now, when the FBI pointed out that such

1565
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,540
information wouldn't be admissible in court,

1566
01:19:39,550 --> 01:19:42,000
Pash made it clear he had no intention of leaving any witness left to prosecute.

1567
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:48,220
Now, the FBI talked him down, but

1568
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:54,000
that's the man you're dancing with.

1569
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:57,000
Together, you've heard there are other parties

1570
01:19:58,350 --> 01:20:03,080
interested in the work of the radiation lab?

1571
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:08,000
The man attached to the Soviet Council indicated, through intermediate legal,

1572
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:11,000
to people on this project that he was in a position to transmit information.

1573
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,000
Well, why would anyone on the project want to do that?

1574
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:18,000
Frankly, I can see that there might be an argument for the Commander-in-Chief informing the

1575
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,020
Russians there are allies, after all, but I don't like the idea of it going out the back door.

1576
01:20:22,030 --> 01:20:26,000
It might not hurt to be. I'm gonna look out for it.

1577
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,000
And you said that to Pash?

1578
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,080
I was trying to put it in the context of Russia's not Germany.

1579
01:20:32,090 --> 01:20:35,000
Ors Pash is the son of a Russian Orthodox bishop. Born here,

1580
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:37,190
but in 1918 he went back to Russia to fight the Bolsheviks.

1581
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:45,000
This is a man who has killed Communists with his own hands.

1582
01:20:45,850 --> 01:20:49,000
I'm not the judge of who should or should not have information.

1583
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:55,000
It's my business to stop him from going through it legally.

1584
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:59,000
Would you be a little more specific?

1585
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,040
There's a man whose name was mentioned to me a couple of times. Eltonton.

1586
01:21:02,050 --> 01:21:05,000
I believe he's a chemist who works at Shell.

1587
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:07,000
He talked to a friend of his who's an acquaintance of someone on the project.

1588
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,000
And you thought that would be satisfying, then?

1589
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,000
I was attempting to give them Eltonton without opening

1590
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:16,810
a can of worms I told them a cock and ghost for you.

1591
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:19,000
Do you let a general grow, too?

1592
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
No. I admit it to him that I'd like to perish.

1593
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:25,130
Do you recall his conversation about the Chevalier incident?

1594
01:21:25,150 --> 01:21:29,000
I've seen so many versions of it. I wasn't confused

1595
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:34,000
before, but I'm certainly getting there now.

1596
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:38,000
Then what was your conclusion?

1597
01:21:38,550 --> 01:21:41,000
That he was under the influence of the typical American schoolboy

1598
01:21:41,950 --> 01:21:45,000
attitude that there's something wicked about telling on a friend.

1599
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:51,000
Oh, well. Might we know through when the contact is made?

1600
01:21:53,600 --> 01:22:00,000
That wouldn't involve people who are not involved in this.

1601
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,080
Is that someone a member of the project?

1602
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:13,000
A member of the faculty, yes, but not in the project.

1603
01:22:13,820 --> 01:22:17,000
So Eltonton made his approach through a member of the faculty here at Berkeley?

1604
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:21,000
As far as I know, yes. There may have been more than one person involved.

1605
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:25,000
If I seem uncooperative, I think you can understand it's because

1606
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
of my insistence on not getting innocent people into trouble.

1607
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
You're trying to protect your friend. Who's protecting you?

1608
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,000
You could. If you gave me the name, you order me to. I'll do it.

1609
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
That's a mistake, Robert. You need to volunteer this name.

1610
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:35,000
Did he give you the name?

1611
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,000
He did, but not that, did he?

1612
01:22:38,150 --> 01:22:42,000
No. No. In fact, it was some months later, wasn't it?

1613
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,980
It wasn't.

1614
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:52,000
You seem his persistence.

1615
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:56,000
Well, you are... you are persistent, but that is your job.

1616
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:04,630
And my job is to protect the people that work for me.

1617
01:23:04,650 --> 01:23:09,000
Instead of us going on certain steps, which may come to your attention,

1618
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:14,000
and be disturbing to you, I would like to discuss those with you first.

1619
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,360
And I'm formulating a plan. I'll just have to digest the whole thing.

1620
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:18,000
In the months in between your interview with Dr. Oppenheimer and his eventual naming

1621
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
of Chevalier, did you expend resources trying to find the name of the intermediary?

1622
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,540
Considerable resources, yes. Without the name, our job was extremely difficult.

1623
01:23:21,550 --> 01:23:24,000
And when did you receive the name?

1624
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
It was gone by the time Oppenheimer finally offered it up.

1625
01:23:26,050 --> 01:23:30,000
Gone?

1626
01:23:30,650 --> 01:23:38,000
They felt my time would be better spent in Europe,

1627
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:42,000
determining the status of the Nazi bomb project.

1628
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Who did?

1629
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
General Groves. He transferred me to London.

1630
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,000
It's a little early for a Christmas party.

1631
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Something's up. I'm told it's been away.

1632
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Where?

1633
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Ruth's old town.

1634
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Come on, you'll think. Can't tell me who can you tell.

1635
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:17,000
How about mentalization, I'll be. What makes you think I know where he is anyway?

1636
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:26,000
Because you're doing a pretty good job of knowing what Mr. Dorman is when it comes.

1637
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Like now?

1638
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Attention!

1639
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Early Christmas present for you all.

1640
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
The British pilot put me in the ball. They filled me the oxygen, but I messed it up.

1641
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,000
When they opened me up in Scotland, I was unconscious.

1642
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:49,000
But I pretended I'd been napping.

1643
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:53,000
He's a choreo party.

1644
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:57,000
He's big enough to end war.

1645
01:24:57,370 --> 01:25:01,000
Heisenberg sought me out in Copenhagen.

1646
01:25:01,850 --> 01:25:04,000
I was chilling, my old student working for the Nazis.

1647
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:08,000
He told me some things to draw me out.

1648
01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:11,000
Sustained fission reactions in uranium.

1649
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
That sounds more like a reactor than a bomb. Did you mention gaseous diffusion?

1650
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
He seemed more focused on heavy water.

1651
01:25:14,370 --> 01:25:17,000
As a moderator?

1652
01:25:17,650 --> 01:25:19,000
Yes, instead of graphite.

1653
01:25:19,570 --> 01:25:21,000
What?

1654
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,000
He took a wrong turn.

1655
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:24,000
Or a head.

1656
01:25:24,650 --> 01:25:28,000
And was you here to help us, Nils?

1657
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:37,000
So could you give us a moment, gentlemen?

1658
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:39,000
I was not here to help Robert.

1659
01:25:39,450 --> 01:25:42,000
I knew you could do this without me.

1660
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Where did you come?

1661
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:47,000
To talk about after.

1662
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:49,000
The power you're about to reveal will forever outlive the Nazis.

1663
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:52,080
And the world is not prepared.

1664
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:56,000
You've lift the stone without being ready for the sting that's revealed.

1665
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:58,000
We have to make the politicians understand this isn't a new weapon.

1666
01:25:58,250 --> 01:26:01,000
It's a new world.

1667
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:04,000
I'll be out there doing what I can but you.

1668
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:08,000
You're an American Prometheus.

1669
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:10,000
The man who gave them the power to destroy themselves.

1670
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:13,000
And they'll respect that.

1671
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:20,000
And your work really begins soon.

1672
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:23,000
I'm sorry, Oppie, but there's a call.

1673
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:31,000
From San Francisco.

1674
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,000
Robert!

1675
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:38,000
Robert?

1676
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Robert?

1677
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Robert?

1678
01:26:40,850 --> 01:26:42,000
Robert?

1679
01:26:42,070 --> 01:26:45,000
What happened?

1680
01:26:45,650 --> 01:26:48,000
My father called.

1681
01:26:49,050 --> 01:26:50,000
We found her yesterday in the bath.

1682
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Who?

1683
01:26:52,850 --> 01:26:55,000
She's taken pills.

1684
01:26:56,050 --> 01:26:59,000
Left a note on sight.

1685
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:04,000
She took barbiturates with Nils Cloraleirid in her blood.

1686
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
There was a note.

1687
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:14,000
She looked out the lock.

1688
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:17,000
We were together.

1689
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:20,000
She said you needed me, I...

1690
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,000
I don't know.

1691
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,000
I wouldn't.

1692
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
I don't know.

1693
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:26,000
I can't.

1694
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:29,680
No, it wasn't me. It was me.

1695
01:27:29,690 --> 01:27:33,000
You don't get to come in the city when your nose

1696
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:37,000
all feels so every bit of it has consequences.

1697
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:45,000
You poor insult, Dickens.

1698
01:27:47,450 --> 01:27:49,000
It'll be clear to bend on you.

1699
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Donald, would you like to contribute here, please?

1700
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,000
You're on the lookout.

1701
01:27:53,870 --> 01:27:56,000
Mom, I'm not quitting my job because plutonium is radioactive.

1702
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,000
We just don't know what it might do to the female reproductive system.

1703
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Your reproductive system is more exposed than mine.

1704
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Tell me, please.

1705
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
The approach device is nowhere.

1706
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Can't rush everything.

1707
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Well, there's rushing and there's getting on with it, so take it.

1708
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
You're right. The man who is doing his job.

1709
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Tell us what's happening.

1710
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,000
You're not helping.

1711
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,000
I've been asking for detonations under your florsion lenses for weeks.

1712
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
The British can do it. Fuse.

1713
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Absolutely.

1714
01:28:18,220 --> 01:28:20,000
It's your job, Tada.

1715
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,080
I'm engaged in the research.

1716
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
We're not hiding them both. We're not even building.

1717
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
I've brought one for the event.

1718
01:28:33,950 --> 01:28:35,000
Oh, no.

1719
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Let him go.

1720
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
He's a prima Donna.

1721
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
I agree. He should leave right now.

1722
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:43,000
Okay.

1723
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Kisti, you replace Metabyte. Seth, I'm putting you on plutonium.

1724
01:28:45,350 --> 01:28:48,000
Lily, you go in for Kisti.

1725
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Because he needs you, Fuchs, you take Tada's role.

1726
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:55,000
I'm putting you exclusively on the implosion device.

1727
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:09,000
And no one is leaving Los Alamos.

1728
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
They both would believe.

1729
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,000
No. I won't let you leave.

1730
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Forget Hans. Forget Fuchs.

1731
01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:20,000
Stay here. Research what you want.

1732
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Fuchs and the hydrogen bomb.

1733
01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:24,000
Whatever. We'll meet to discuss.

1734
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
You don't have time to meet.

1735
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
You're a politician now, Robert.

1736
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,000
You've left physics behind many, many years ago.

1737
01:29:30,150 --> 01:29:34,000
One week. One hour. You and me.

1738
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:42,000
Now raise this fucking barrier.

1739
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:50,000
So the super was an underdevelopment on your watch in Los Alamos.

1740
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Yes.

1741
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:55,000
And yet, after the war, you tried to deny it was viable.

1742
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,000
No, no, no. I pointed out technical differently.

1743
01:29:58,850 --> 01:30:01,170
Didn't you try to kill it at the AEC meeting after the Russian bomb test?

1744
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:02,000
No.

1745
01:30:02,050 --> 01:30:05,000
But that was the recommendation of the AEC, was it not?

1746
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:08,000
After hours of discussion about the best response.

1747
01:30:08,550 --> 01:30:14,000
An H-bomb is one thousand times the power of an A-bomb.

1748
01:30:14,850 --> 01:30:18,000
Its only intended target would be the largest city.

1749
01:30:18,850 --> 01:30:20,000
It's a weapon of mass genocide.

1750
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Is he dressed in circles on this side of the map,

1751
01:30:23,450 --> 01:30:26,000
where they would target us, starting in New York?

1752
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,000
As a DC.

1753
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:31,000
It's a weapon of attack. No difference involved in deterrence.

1754
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Do we really need more deterrence than our friend, our slow atomic bombs?

1755
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:39,000
You drown in ten feet of water or ten thousand, what's the difference?

1756
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
We can already drown.

1757
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
We can only drown in two feet.

1758
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:52,000
As I said, the tellers' designs are still

1759
01:30:55,250 --> 01:31:00,000
as impractical as they were during the war.

1760
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
An hydrogen bomb can be made to work, I'll be you know that.

1761
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,000
I don't believe we should commit all our resources to that chance.

1762
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Then how would you have Truman reassure the American people?

1763
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:11,180
Simply by limiting the spread of atomic weapons

1764
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:14,000
through international control and nuclear energy.

1765
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:16,000
By which mean world government.

1766
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,000
The United Nations has Roosevelt intended it.

1767
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Well, I asked what Truman should do, right?

1768
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:26,000
The world's change is not fascism, but communism that now threatens our survival.

1769
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Lewis, do you understand if we build a hydrogen bomb,

1770
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:32,000
the Russians will have no choice but to build their own.

1771
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,540
Could they be working on one already, based on

1772
01:31:34,550 --> 01:31:37,000
information gathered from spy at Los Alamos?

1773
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
No spy at Los Alamos.

1774
01:31:38,050 --> 01:31:41,000
Gentlemen, let's not get sidetracked.

1775
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:44,000
I say we use this moment to gain concessions from the Russians

1776
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,000
by committing that we will not build a hydrogen bomb.

1777
01:31:47,150 --> 01:31:49,000
Thereby revealing its existence.

1778
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:51,140
Which you've seen convinced they already know.

1779
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:56,000
All right. At this point, I'd like the committee members

1780
01:31:56,020 --> 01:31:59,000
to meet in privacy to finalize our recommendations.

1781
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,000
I'm just not sure you want to get down to this.

1782
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:06,000
With respect, we are the advisory committee. We will give them our advice.

1783
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:08,000
Okay.

1784
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Dr. Oppenheimer.

1785
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:13,200
Hi.

1786
01:32:14,050 --> 01:32:15,050
William Borden.

1787
01:32:15,650 --> 01:32:17,000
Joined committee on atomic energy.

1788
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Oh, it is.

1789
01:32:18,350 --> 01:32:21,000
During the war, I was a pilot.

1790
01:32:21,150 --> 01:32:25,000
One night, flying back from a raid, I saw an amazing sight.

1791
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:30,000
I got a meteor. A V-2 rocket headed England.

1792
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,480
I can't help but imagine what it will be for

1793
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:35,000
such an enemy rocket to carry an atomic war.

1794
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:37,000
Quiet.

1795
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Let's make sure we're not the ones to make that possible.

1796
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,000
Bobby, I don't think you want to go up against Shros.

1797
01:32:57,400 --> 01:33:00,000
If we both speak, they listen to me.

1798
01:33:00,150 --> 01:33:02,000
When you speak, they hear a prophet.

1799
01:33:02,370 --> 01:33:04,000
When Shros speaks, they hear themselves.

1800
01:33:04,150 --> 01:33:06,000
They listen to a prophet.

1801
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:09,000
A prophet can't be wrong. Not once.

1802
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Did you accuse Oppenheimer of sabotaging the development of the super?

1803
01:33:13,650 --> 01:33:17,000
I was never one of those to be any wrong terms like sabotage.

1804
01:33:17,350 --> 01:33:19,000
But Mr. Borden was?

1805
01:33:19,250 --> 01:33:21,000
As I understand it, possibly.

1806
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:25,000
How was Mr. Borden able to put together such a detailed indictment?

1807
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
He was no longer a government employee.

1808
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,000
He appears to have had unlimited access to Dr. Oppenheimer's file.

1809
01:33:30,350 --> 01:33:35,000
Like Mr. Nichols, I've given him access to the file or someone else at the AEC.

1810
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,000
That's very serious accusations.

1811
01:33:38,250 --> 01:33:39,820
Is it your intention to suggest that

1812
01:33:39,830 --> 01:33:42,000
Dr. Oppenheimer is disloyal to the United States?

1813
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:47,000
I've always assumed and still assume that he's loyal to the United States.

1814
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:52,000
I believe this and I shall read it until I see very conclusive proof to the opposite.

1815
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Do you or do you not believe that Dr. Oppenheimer is a security prisoner?

1816
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Well, we at least have to take a moment to think about

1817
01:34:05,150 --> 01:34:14,000
whether the means justify

1818
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,930
the ends any longer because...

1819
01:34:16,940 --> 01:34:20,000
Germany is about to surrender.

1820
01:34:22,550 --> 01:34:25,000
Yes.

1821
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Mr. Bonger, the enemy who were the greatest threat to mankind, it's our work.

1822
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:32,000
It was dead. It's true.

1823
01:34:34,550 --> 01:34:37,000
With a Japanese fight on.

1824
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:40,000
Their defeat seems assured.

1825
01:34:40,650 --> 01:34:42,000
Not if you're a GI prepared to invade.

1826
01:34:42,450 --> 01:34:45,000
We can end this war.

1827
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
But how do we justify using this weapon, she thinks.

1828
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:51,000
We're theorists.

1829
01:34:54,350 --> 01:34:56,000
Yes.

1830
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
We imagine a future and our imaginings horrify us.

1831
01:34:58,550 --> 01:35:03,000
They won't fear it until they understand it and

1832
01:35:04,050 --> 01:35:06,510
they won't understand it until they've used it.

1833
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:09,000
When the world learns the terrible secret of Los Alamos,

1834
01:35:09,150 --> 01:35:13,000
our work here will ensure peace mankind has never seen.

1835
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,000
The peace based on the kind of international

1836
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,980
cooperation that Roosevelt always envisaged.

1837
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Progress?

1838
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Two years and a million dollars worth.

1839
01:35:27,050 --> 01:35:28,050
Hard to put a price in your town.

1840
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:30,000
Not really. Just out of the bills.

1841
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Rural free deliveries.

1842
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Eighty babies delivered the first year.

1843
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
This year we've had ten a month.

1844
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Earth controls that do not align to restriction general.

1845
01:35:38,150 --> 01:35:41,000
Clearly.

1846
01:35:41,050 --> 01:35:44,000
General.

1847
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Head down.

1848
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Here you are.

1849
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Folks, head down.

1850
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
That's the war.

1851
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Two viable bombs.

1852
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,000
I need a date.

1853
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:02,000
September.

1854
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
July.

1855
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
That's a sweet one, gentlemen.

1856
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
August.

1857
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
July.

1858
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:10,000
Test.

1859
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
July.

1860
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:14,000
I need my brother.

1861
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:16,000
Frank goes to the desert.

1862
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000
He's left politics behind.

1863
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
He's been working with Mars for two years now.

1864
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,000
What do we call the test?

1865
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
A pet of my heart. A three person god.

1866
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:25,000
What?

1867
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Truly.

1868
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,000
You insisted on bringing

1869
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
on your brother Frank.

1870
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:37,000
A known communist.

1871
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Former communist.

1872
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:44,000
You brought a known former communist.

1873
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
On to America's most secret

1874
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
and important defense project.

1875
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:55,000
I knew my brother could be trusted.

1876
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Absolutely.

1877
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,000
And you felt your judgment was sound

1878
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
at who on the team could be trusted.

1879
01:37:00,650 --> 01:37:03,000
Folks, head down.

1880
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Everybody ready?

1881
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
I hope you learned something.

1882
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,000
We've learned we're going to need to be a lot farther away.

1883
01:37:09,700 --> 01:37:13,000
I'll figure it out.

1884
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:15,000
Fast.

1885
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
We need a Washington in the morning.

1886
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:26,000
We're going to give him a date.

1887
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
You're a long way from Chicago, Leo.

1888
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
If we don't act now, they're going to use this thing in East Japan.

1889
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,000
We booked a meeting with Truman, but somebody killed it.

1890
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
You were meeting the secretary of war.

1891
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Just because we're building it,

1892
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,240
doesn't mean we get to decide how it's used.

1893
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:50,000
History will judge us for that.

1894
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
In Chicago, we put together a petition.

1895
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:55,000
I'm not... I'm not telling you to do that.

1896
01:37:55,050 --> 01:37:58,000
Just tell me your concerns and I will leave them.

1897
01:37:58,250 --> 01:38:00,000
My concerns?

1898
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Germany's defeated.

1899
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:04,060
Japan's not going to hold out alone.

1900
01:38:04,950 --> 01:38:07,000
How could you know that?

1901
01:38:07,850 --> 01:38:10,000
You got us into this.

1902
01:38:10,550 --> 01:38:12,000
You and Einstein with your letter to Roosevelt saying we could build a bomb.

1903
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:17,000
I guess Germany.

1904
01:38:17,620 --> 01:38:19,000
That's not how weapons manufacture works, Cillit.

1905
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Hoping you have to help.

1906
01:38:20,850 --> 01:38:22,000
Fermi's in the meeting.

1907
01:38:22,450 --> 01:38:24,000
Lawrence is in the meeting.

1908
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,000
They're not you.

1909
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
You're the great salesman of science.

1910
01:38:26,450 --> 01:38:29,020
You can convince anyone of anything.

1911
01:38:29,050 --> 01:38:30,000
Even yourself.

1912
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Excuse me.

1913
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,000
The firestorm in Tokyo killed 100,000 people.

1914
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Mostly civilians.

1915
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,000
I worry about America when we do these things and no one protests.

1916
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Pearl Harbor and three years of brutal conflict in the Pacific.

1917
01:38:37,170 --> 01:38:39,000
Buys a lot of latitude with the American public.

1918
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Enough to when we see a target bomb?

1919
01:38:43,450 --> 01:38:45,000
The air bomb might not cause as much damage as the Tokyo bombs.

1920
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:47,000
What are we estimating?

1921
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:50,000
In a medium-sized city, 20,000 or 30,000 dead.

1922
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,000
But don't underestimate the psychological impact of a atomic explosion.

1923
01:38:53,650 --> 01:38:56,000
A pillar of fire 10,000 feet tall.

1924
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Deadly neutron effects from a mile in all directions.

1925
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,000
From one single device dropped from a barely-known SP-29.

1926
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:04,000
The atomic bomb will be a terrible revelation of divine power.

1927
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:08,000
If that's true, it would be definitive.

1928
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
World War II would be over.

1929
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Our boys would come home.

1930
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Military targets.

1931
01:39:20,300 --> 01:39:24,000
But there aren't any big enough.

1932
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Perhaps a vital war plant with workers housed nearby.

1933
01:39:28,750 --> 01:39:33,000
And we could issue a warning

1934
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:39,000
to reduce civilian casualties.

1935
01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:42,000
It'd send everything they have up against us.

1936
01:39:42,150 --> 01:39:44,000
I'd be up in that plane.

1937
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,000
But if we announce it and it fails to go off,

1938
01:39:46,050 --> 01:39:48,000
we'd scupper any chance of a Japanese surrender.

1939
01:39:48,670 --> 01:39:50,000
Is there no way to demonstrate the bomb to Japan to propose surrender?

1940
01:39:50,550 --> 01:39:56,000
We intend to demonstrate it in the most unambiguous terms.

1941
01:39:56,850 --> 01:39:59,210
Twice.

1942
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:02,000
Once to show the weapons power

1943
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,000
and a second to show that we can keep doing this until they surrender.

1944
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:06,000
We have a list of 12 cities to choose from.

1945
01:40:06,670 --> 01:40:09,000
I'm sorry, 11.

1946
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:13,000
I've taken Kyoto off the list

1947
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:17,000
due to its cultural significance to the Japanese people.

1948
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Also, my wife and I honeymooned there.

1949
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:20,000
It's a magnificent city.

1950
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Let me make this simple for you, gentlemen.

1951
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,000
According to my intelligence, which I cannot share

1952
01:40:27,150 --> 01:40:29,000
with you, the Japanese people will not surrender.

1953
01:40:29,350 --> 01:40:31,000
Under any circumstances.

1954
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Short of a successful and total invasion of the home islands.

1955
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:37,000
Many lives will be the longest American and Japanese.

1956
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:39,000
The use of the atomic bomb in Japanese cities will save lives.

1957
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:44,120
If we retain moral advantage.

1958
01:40:44,150 --> 01:40:47,000
How so?

1959
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
If we use this weapon without informing our allies, they'll see it as a threat.

1960
01:40:49,100 --> 01:40:51,000
We'll be in an arms race.

1961
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,000
How often can we be with the Soviets?

1962
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:57,000
Secrecy won't stop the Soviets from becoming part of the atomic world.

1963
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,000
We've been told they have no uranium.

1964
01:41:01,650 --> 01:41:04,000
You've been misinformed.

1965
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,000
A Russian bomb is a matter of time.

1966
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,000
The program needs to continue at full pace after the war.

1967
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Uh, Secretary Simpson, if I may.

1968
01:41:10,450 --> 01:41:12,000
Not all scientists on the project are in agreement.

1969
01:41:12,550 --> 01:41:16,000
In fact, this might be a moment to consider other opinions.

1970
01:41:16,050 --> 01:41:18,000
If you talk as soon as this project has been plagued from the start

1971
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
by certain scientists of doubtful

1972
01:41:20,050 --> 01:41:22,000
discretion and uncertain loyalty.

1973
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,000
One of them just tried to meet with the president.

1974
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:28,000
Now, we need these men, but as soon as it's practical,

1975
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:32,000
we should sever any such scientist from the program.

1976
01:41:32,050 --> 01:41:35,000
Wouldn't you agree, Doctor?

1977
01:41:35,420 --> 01:41:38,000
If a Russian bomb is inevitable,

1978
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:43,000
perhaps we should invite their top scientist to Trinity.

1979
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:45,500
President Truman has no intention of raising expectations

1980
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:49,000
that Stalin be included in the atomic project.

1981
01:41:49,050 --> 01:41:51,020
Informing him of our breakthrough and presenting it as a means to win the war.

1982
01:41:51,050 --> 01:41:53,000
did not make unkeepable promises.

1983
01:41:53,950 --> 01:41:56,000
But the Potsdam Peace Conference in July will be

1984
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:59,000
President Truman's last chance to have that conversation.

1985
01:41:59,350 --> 01:42:03,000
Can you give us a working bomb by then?

1986
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:06,000
Absolutely. We will test fire before the conference.

1987
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:09,120
Ground zero. Observation boasts at 10,000 yards north, south, and west.

1988
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:11,000
Where do we trigger from?

1989
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:15,000
South 10,000.

1990
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
And base camp is 10 miles south here.

1991
01:42:17,850 --> 01:42:20,000
And there's a further observation post on that hill 20 miles away.

1992
01:42:20,700 --> 01:42:24,000
Is that right? Your lines already went in.

1993
01:42:25,100 --> 01:42:35,000
The Air Force requested a line of lights for their B-29.

1994
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,000
What B-29? Our bombs on the tower.

1995
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:38,000
They want to use the test to confirm the safe operating distance.

1996
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:41,000
It's risky.

1997
01:42:41,050 --> 01:42:47,000
But not as risky as dropping one over Japan

1998
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:49,000
and hoping that we were right about the blast radius.

1999
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:53,000
It's a little so astound. We're firing on the 15th.

2000
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
The 15th? That's the 15th.

2001
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:59,000
15th.

2002
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,000
So while we're here in South Observation

2003
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Point with Frank and Kistiakowsky,

2004
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
we'll all be assigned to base camp, west observation, or fire observation.

2005
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Just a little careful with your eyes.

2006
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Your safe distances are based on your calculations.

2007
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Time to stand behind your science arms, literally.

2008
01:43:12,650 --> 01:43:17,000
What about the radiation cloud?

2009
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Without high winds, it should settle within two to three miles.

2010
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Vacuation measures are in place.

2011
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:41,000
But we need good weather for visibility, so it has to be fine.

2012
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Everybody out.

2013
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:54,000
You're on the night of the 15th.

2014
01:43:54,000 --> 01:44:14,000
It's a hard deadline.

2015
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
If anyone does anything, speak now.

2016
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Could you survive an explosion test?

2017
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Could not do it.

2018
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Is there anything else that might stop us?

2019
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
What's happening, isn't it?

2020
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:39,000
I'll send a message.

2021
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
It's gone our way.

2022
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Take it in the streets.

2023
01:44:44,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Robert.

2024
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Rick Land.

2025
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Three years, 4,000 people, $2 billion.

2026
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:17,000
So it doesn't go off.

2027
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:46,000
We're both finished.

2028
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:51,000
I'm betting on three kilotons.

2029
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Anything less?

2030
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:57,000
I won't get what it is.

2031
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:00,000
And what did Fermi mean

2032
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
by atmospheric ignition?

2033
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:07,000
We had a moment where it looked like the chain

2034
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:11,000
reaction from a atomic device might never have stopped.

2035
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Setting fire to the atmosphere.

2036
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:31,000
And what was Fermi

2037
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:41,000
still taking side bets on it?

2038
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Call it gallows humor.

2039
01:46:51,220 --> 01:47:01,000
Are we saying there's a chance that when we push that button, we destroy the world?

2040
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Nothing in our research over three years was that conclusion.

2041
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Except it's the most remote possibility.

2042
01:47:51,000 --> 01:48:01,000
How remote?

2043
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Chances are near zero.

2044
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Near zero.

2045
01:48:51,000 --> 01:49:01,000
What do you want

2046
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:21,000
from theory alone?

2047
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:23,000
Zero would be nice.

2048
01:49:23,650 --> 01:49:25,000
We've been exactly

2049
01:49:25,950 --> 01:49:30,000
one hour, 58 minutes.

2050
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Well done.

2051
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
It's loading up.

2052
01:49:33,350 --> 01:49:37,000
The Army parties left zero.

2053
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
They're heading this way.

2054
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Throw me switches.

2055
01:49:42,250 --> 01:49:45,000
Turn the cars.

2056
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Ready for emergency.

2057
01:49:48,050 --> 01:49:50,000
After my shoot.

2058
01:49:53,050 --> 01:49:59,000
Everybody take a roller splash.

2059
01:49:59,050 --> 01:50:03,000
Everybody take a roller splash.

2060
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Twenty minutes.

2061
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Twenty minutes.

2062
01:50:07,450 --> 01:50:09,000
That's twenty.

2063
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:12,000
The ladies.

2064
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:15,000
Come on.

2065
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Now.

2066
01:50:20,050 --> 01:50:27,000
The glass.

2067
01:50:27,050 --> 01:50:29,000
It stops the UV.

2068
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:36,000
It stops the glass.

2069
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:48,000
I had the base 10.

2070
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
That's the fire.

2071
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Robert.

2072
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Try to work the world.

2073
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:53,000
What's that mean?

2074
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:54,000
If the detonator's still charged, the voltage drops by one volt.

2075
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
You hit that button, you abort.

2076
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:17,000
I'm starting.

2077
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Everybody down.

2078
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Do not tilt around until you see what's working on the hills.

2079
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Then look at the explosion holding through your wellness glass.

2080
01:51:52,000 --> 01:52:13,000
I keep that here.

2081
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Do detonator.

2082
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:20,000
Do you second these two detonations?

2083
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Do you think I'm in?

2084
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Yeah.

2085
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:38,000
These things are hard in your heart.

2086
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Thirty seconds.

2087
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Give me your charge.

2088
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,000
I have a game. I have a game.

2089
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,000
I'm in. I have a game. Four.

2090
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Four.

2091
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Three. Two. One.

2092
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
And now I am the Conde,

2093
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
the destroyer of worlds.

2094
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
It worked.

2095
01:52:54,000 --> 01:53:06,000
No interest dollars.

2096
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Go on.

2097
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:11,000
I'm good for it, Kisti.

2098
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
You are.

2099
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Yes, you are.

2100
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Give me a pot stand right away.

2101
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Hello.

2102
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Hi, Kisti.

2103
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:34,000
What?

2104
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Charlotte.

2105
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Charlotte, go ahead.

2106
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Oh, um, oh, I don't know.

2107
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Can I help you to

2108
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:44,000
bring in the cheese?

2109
01:53:44,000 --> 01:54:09,000
Kitty?

2110
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Kitty?

2111
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
If they did it too high in the air,

2112
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:19,000
the blast would be as powerful.

2113
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:29,000
With respect, Dr. Oppenheimer, we'll take it from here.

2114
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:34,000
The true one, brief stolen, a pot stand.

2115
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:44,000
The brief would be an overstatement.

2116
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:58,000
He referred to a powerful

2117
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:04,000
new weapon, stolen.

2118
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Hope we use it against Japan.

2119
01:55:33,000 --> 01:56:02,000
That's it.

2120
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:31,000
The one where we've given them an ace, it's for them to play the hand.

2121
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:37,000
You're heavy for the six.

2122
01:56:37,300 --> 01:56:45,000
It's of the C.O. in the Pacific.

2123
01:56:46,070 --> 01:57:03,000
If anything comes through, to Washington.

2124
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Before.

2125
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
When you keep informed.

2126
01:57:27,350 --> 01:57:53,000
Of course.

2127
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:57,000
As best I can.

2128
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
What did the Japanese surrender if

2129
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
they knew about what was coming?

2130
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
I don't know.

2131
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Everything's here,

2132
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:34,000
that's a petition.

2133
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:42,000
How the hell is so no matter Japanese? Not signing an item?

2134
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Many people are.

2135
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:55,000
A lot of people.

2136
01:58:55,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Pidrode.

2137
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:16,000
The fact that we built this

2138
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,000
bond does not give us any more,

2139
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:18,000
any more right or responsibility

2140
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:19,000
to decide how it's used.

2141
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:20,000
And anyone else.

2142
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
But they're the only

2143
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:25,000
people who know about it.

2144
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
I'm told steps in the various

2145
01:59:27,100 --> 01:59:29,000
opinions of the community.

2146
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
But what's your opinion?

2147
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:40,000
Once it's used,

2148
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:43,000
it will clear war.

2149
01:59:43,300 --> 01:59:47,000
Perhaps all war

2150
01:59:49,500 --> 01:59:57,000
becomes unthinkable.

2151
01:59:57,250 --> 02:00:00,000
Until somebody builds a bigger bond.

2152
02:00:00,250 --> 02:00:03,000
I thought they would call.

2153
02:00:03,450 --> 02:00:09,000
It's only that fast.

2154
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:13,000
And it's the sixth.

2155
02:00:13,200 --> 02:00:15,000
Charlotte?

2156
02:00:15,800 --> 02:00:20,000
Trigross?

2157
02:00:20,300 --> 02:00:23,000
Anything?

2158
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:26,000
Charlotte?

2159
02:00:26,150 --> 02:00:30,000
Trubit's on the radio.

2160
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:33,000
General?

2161
02:00:33,120 --> 02:00:36,000
I'm very proud of you

2162
02:00:36,150 --> 02:00:39,000
and all of your people.

2163
02:00:39,300 --> 02:00:42,000
It went all right.

2164
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Apparently it went with a tremendous bang.

2165
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:02,000
You know, everyone here is feeling reasonably good about it.

2166
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:06,000
It's been a long road.

2167
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
I think one of the

2168
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:13,000
wisest things I ever did

2169
02:01:13,400 --> 02:01:16,000
was when I selected the director of Los Alamos.

2170
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
We asked him for the two billion dollars on the

2171
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:21,230
greatest scientific gamble in history, and we have won.

2172
02:01:21,240 --> 02:01:24,000
The world will remember this day.

2173
02:01:24,450 --> 02:01:26,000
It's too soon to--it's too soon to determine

2174
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
what the results of the bombing are.

2175
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:31,000
But I'll bet the

2176
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Japanese didn't like it.

2177
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:37,000
I'm so proud.

2178
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:43,000
So proud of what you have accomplished.

2179
02:01:43,350 --> 02:01:46,000
I just wish we had it in time to use against the Germans.

2180
02:01:46,970 --> 02:02:06,000
Dr. Oppenheimer. Dr. Oppenheimer.

2181
02:02:06,700 --> 02:02:08,000
Nice picture. Prison criminals need help.

2182
02:02:08,200 --> 02:02:12,000
Dr. Oppenheimer, it's an honor. Mr. President, please. Thank you.

2183
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:14,000
Sixteen minutes.

2184
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:27,000
How does it feel to be the most famous man in the

2185
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:30,000
world? You helped save a lot of American lives.

2186
02:02:30,350 --> 02:02:33,000
What we did at Hiroshima was--

2187
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:36,000
In Nagasaki.

2188
02:02:36,350 --> 02:02:38,000
Obviously. Your invention let us bring our boys home.

2189
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
It was hardly my invention.

2190
02:02:40,200 --> 02:03:02,000
Well, it's you on the cover at time.

2191
02:03:03,050 --> 02:03:22,000
Jim tells me you're concerned about an arms race for the Soviets.

2192
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Yes. Well, it's that now is our chance to secure

2193
02:03:23,050 --> 02:03:26,000
international cooperation on atomic energy and I'm concerned.

2194
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Did you know when the Soviets

2195
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:31,000
are going to have the bomb?

2196
02:03:31,150 --> 02:03:36,000
I don't think I could give you--

2197
02:03:36,850 --> 02:03:38,000
Never. Never.

2198
02:03:38,150 --> 02:03:40,930
Mr. President, the Russians have good physicists and abundant resources.

2199
02:03:40,940 --> 02:03:44,000
Abundance?

2200
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
Yes.

2201
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:51,510
I don't think so.

2202
02:03:51,530 --> 02:03:58,000
Well, don't put

2203
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:27,000
everything they have in--

2204
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:45,000
I hear you're leaving Los Atoms. What should we do with it?

2205
02:04:45,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Give it back to the Indians.

2206
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:25,000
Dr. Oppenheimer, if what

2207
02:05:25,050 --> 02:05:30,000
you say about the Soviets is

2208
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:39,000
true, we have to build up Los Alamos, not shut it down.

2209
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:48,000
Mr. President, I feel that I have flattened all my hands.

2210
02:05:48,870 --> 02:05:58,000
You think anyone in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, gives a shit who built the bomb?

2211
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
They care who dropped it. I did.

2212
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:20,000
Hiroshima isn't about you.

2213
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:23,000
Dr. Oppenheimer.

2214
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:32,000
Don't let that cry

2215
02:06:32,550 --> 02:06:36,000
make me back in here.

2216
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Robert saw that hand-wringing got him

2217
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:12,000
nowhere, and by the time I met him, he fully

2218
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:30,000
embraced his father's bomb reputation and used his profile to influence policy.

2219
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:48,000
Dr. in the years following the

2220
02:07:48,000 --> 02:08:06,000
war, would you say that you

2221
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:24,000
exerted a great influence on

2222
02:08:24,050 --> 02:08:47,000
the atomic policies of the USA?

2223
02:08:47,500 --> 02:08:54,000
I think great.

2224
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:57,000
We know this, they meant it.

2225
02:08:57,850 --> 02:09:01,480
Really? We're going to be sure

2226
02:09:01,490 --> 02:09:05,000
of isotopes. We're not personally

2227
02:09:05,050 --> 02:09:08,000
responsible for destroying

2228
02:09:08,120 --> 02:09:10,000
all opposition to their export.

2229
02:09:10,150 --> 02:09:15,000
Can you, uh, about look beer? Making atomic weapons, in fact, you do.

2230
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:18,000
I was the spokesman, but the opinion

2231
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:22,000
among scientists was unanimous.

2232
02:09:23,900 --> 02:09:27,000
All along, McCarthy on the

2233
02:09:27,700 --> 02:09:33,980
rise, he knew he was vulnerable.

2234
02:09:33,990 --> 02:09:42,000
His brother was blacklisted by

2235
02:09:42,420 --> 02:09:45,000
every university in the country.

2236
02:09:45,550 --> 02:09:47,000
A woman in the squad working the railroad, laying track.

2237
02:09:47,150 --> 02:09:51,000
Like Chevalier, went into exile.

2238
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:56,000
But none of that stopped Robert from pushing the

2239
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:57,000
GAC to recommend arms control instead of the H-bomb.

2240
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:58,000
He was devastated when Truman rejected their recommendation.

2241
02:09:58,400 --> 02:10:00,000
I miss Richard more than I can bear to think of.

2242
02:10:02,600 --> 02:10:08,000
I'm glad he didn't live to see what this is all about.

2243
02:10:08,100 --> 02:10:14,000
Here comes the

2244
02:10:24,100 --> 02:10:25,220
birthday boy. Pull out.

2245
02:10:25,250 --> 02:10:31,490
Have fun with him.

2246
02:10:31,500 --> 02:10:38,000
Robert, my son and his fiancée are best words

2247
02:10:45,500 --> 02:10:50,000
to me, the father of

2248
02:10:51,000 --> 02:11:08,000
the atomic bomb, so...

2249
02:11:08,900 --> 02:11:20,000
Suspect. What do

2250
02:11:20,650 --> 02:11:27,000
you think, Lewis?

2251
02:11:27,550 --> 02:11:36,000
I think I must have enveloped you.

2252
02:11:36,400 --> 02:11:49,000
To the world.

2253
02:11:49,300 --> 02:11:57,000
The world? What does fukes mean to the rest of the world?

2254
02:11:57,150 --> 02:12:07,750
Fukes. Class fukes.

2255
02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:18,000
Oh, dear. You haven't heard.

2256
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,440
Class fukes. They're British scientists that

2257
02:12:20,450 --> 02:12:23,000
you put onto the implosion team at Los Alamos.

2258
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:24,000
Turns out he was...

2259
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
After the truth about fukes came up, the FBI stepped up surveillance on him.

2260
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:29,130
He knew his phone was tapped.

2261
02:12:29,140 --> 02:12:32,000
He's fallen everywhere.

2262
02:12:32,350 --> 02:12:36,000
He's trashed big through.

2263
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:40,000
But never stop speaking his mind.

2264
02:12:40,800 --> 02:12:44,750
Man of conviction.

2265
02:12:44,760 --> 02:12:49,000
And maybe he thought fame

2266
02:12:49,750 --> 02:12:54,000
could actually protect him.

2267
02:12:54,850 --> 02:12:58,000
When Eisenhower took

2268
02:12:58,870 --> 02:13:02,760
office, he saw one more chance.

2269
02:13:02,770 --> 02:13:07,000
He took it.

2270
02:13:07,450 --> 02:13:13,000
America and Russia maybe likened to two scorpions in a bottle.

2271
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Each capable of killing the other, but only at the risk of his own life.

2272
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:20,000
There are various aspects of his policy.

2273
02:13:20,200 --> 02:13:26,000
Modern scientists blame me, but how was I supposed to protect him?

2274
02:13:26,200 --> 02:13:28,000
It's a too secret for discussion.

2275
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:31,050
Candor is the only remedy.

2276
02:13:31,060 --> 02:13:34,000
Officials in Washington need to start leveling the American media.

2277
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:45,000
That was last straw for Robert Sotomayor.

2278
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:47,360
So he had to lose his security class.

2279
02:13:47,600 --> 02:13:50,000
And with it, his credibility.

2280
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:54,000
But how could they do it?

2281
02:13:54,850 --> 02:13:58,000
It was a war hero.

2282
02:13:59,350 --> 02:14:02,000
He'd already told everyone about his past.

2283
02:14:03,450 --> 02:14:06,640
The board wouldn't have drenched it all up.

2284
02:14:06,650 --> 02:14:10,000
How could board get access to Oppenheimer's FBI file?

2285
02:14:10,850 --> 02:14:12,000
Could it have been Nichols?

2286
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:17,000
No, I can't imagine if I could do that.

2287
02:14:19,250 --> 02:14:27,000
Whoever did, at least if I

2288
02:14:27,300 --> 02:14:29,000
were a storm that burned a

2289
02:14:30,100 --> 02:14:31,100
path from the White House, or to my desk, the A.E.C.

2290
02:14:31,150 --> 02:14:34,000
You see him in there, right?

2291
02:14:37,370 --> 02:14:40,000
I worked my whole life to get here.

2292
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
To Canada, the United States of America, now and from the entire country.

2293
02:14:42,300 --> 02:14:46,000
They're going to put me back in my place.

2294
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:50,000
A low-leaf shoe salesman.

2295
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Lewis, we can win this thing.

2296
02:14:52,400 --> 02:14:59,000
I think we can get the sun off the grass, but you did your duty.

2297
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:06,000
A painful bill was.

2298
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
Will Hill's testimony back us up?

2299
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Hill will be fine.

2300
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
I don't really know him, but it was

2301
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
when his Silveridge boys in Chicago

2302
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:21,000
never forgave Robert for not supporting a petition against bombing Japan.

2303
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:24,000
This was taken 31 days after the bombing.

2304
02:15:24,450 --> 02:15:27,000
Virtually everyone in the street, nearly a mile around,

2305
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
was instantly and seriously burned.

2306
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
The Japanese spoke of people who wore striped

2307
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
clothing upon whom the skin was burned in stripes.

2308
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
There were many who

2309
02:15:35,350 --> 02:15:37,070
thought themselves lucky,

2310
02:15:37,400 --> 02:15:40,000
who climbed out of the ruins of their homes, only slightly injured.

2311
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
But they died anyway.

2312
02:15:42,100 --> 02:15:44,000
They died days or weeks later,

2313
02:15:44,550 --> 02:15:48,000
from the ritium-like rays emitted in great numbers at the moment of the explosion.

2314
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:51,000
Did you read the scrap in the papers?

2315
02:15:51,300 --> 02:15:53,000
The British physicists say the atomic bombings

2316
02:15:53,900 --> 02:15:56,000
were not the last act of World War II,

2317
02:15:57,100 --> 02:16:01,000
but the first act of this Cold War with Russia.

2318
02:16:01,300 --> 02:16:04,000
Which physicist?

2319
02:16:04,600 --> 02:16:06,000
I think you knew him. Patrick Blackett.

2320
02:16:07,100 --> 02:16:09,000
They may not be wrong. Stimson is now telling me

2321
02:16:09,250 --> 02:16:12,000
they bound an enemy that was essentially defeated.

2322
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
Robert, you have all the influence now.

2323
02:16:14,050 --> 02:16:16,000
Please, urge them to continue my research on the super.

2324
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Anything can or will, Edward.

2325
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Why not? It's not the right use of our resources.

2326
02:16:20,050 --> 02:16:24,000
Is that what you really believe?

2327
02:16:25,300 --> 02:16:29,000
Gee, Robert Oppenheimer, sphinx thy guru of the atom.

2328
02:16:29,650 --> 02:16:34,000
Nobody knows what you believe.

2329
02:16:34,650 --> 02:16:38,000
Do you?

2330
02:16:39,050 --> 02:16:42,800
One final time, our program director, Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.

2331
02:16:42,810 --> 02:16:47,000
I hope that it used to come, and we'll look back on your work here with pride.

2332
02:16:47,650 --> 02:16:50,000
But today, that pride must be tempered with a profound concern.

2333
02:16:50,520 --> 02:16:55,000
If atomic weapons are to be added to the arsenals of a warring world,

2334
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:58,000
then the day will come when people will curse the name of Los Alamos.

2335
02:16:58,400 --> 02:17:01,000
Sorry, I'm wrong.

2336
02:17:01,700 --> 02:17:07,000
Stop, doffs, forget this.

2337
02:17:08,250 --> 02:17:10,000
Seems pretty favorable.

2338
02:17:10,350 --> 02:17:12,880
There's Oppenheimer. What's the caption?

2339
02:17:12,890 --> 02:17:15,000
J. Robert Oppenheimer, straw is fought.

2340
02:17:15,170 --> 02:17:18,000
And the US won.

2341
02:17:18,650 --> 02:17:20,000
That'll work.

2342
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:23,000
Those were your words from the other day.

2343
02:17:25,670 --> 02:17:28,270
We needed to pivot.

2344
02:17:28,280 --> 02:17:31,000
But how would you know what Time magazine's gonna write?

2345
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Henry Luce was a friend.

2346
02:17:35,100 --> 02:17:39,000
You sat here and let me tell you how it's done.

2347
02:17:39,200 --> 02:17:41,000
But you've been far ahead all along.

2348
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:44,000
Survival in Washington.

2349
02:17:44,820 --> 02:17:46,100
I was about to know how to get things done.

2350
02:17:47,100 --> 02:17:51,000
Right.

2351
02:17:51,950 --> 02:17:54,000
What was it you said about Borden?

2352
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:56,000
Why get caught holding the knife yourself?

2353
02:17:56,400 --> 02:18:02,000
I make it into the thing that Borden was holding the knife for you.

2354
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:08,000
It's gonna come down to how much influence Borden's been able to observe.

2355
02:18:08,950 --> 02:18:13,000
Tell her.

2356
02:18:15,150 --> 02:18:19,000
Did I say something funny?

2357
02:18:20,150 --> 02:18:24,000
It's Borden, Borden, Borden. When we all know that it's straws.

2358
02:18:28,100 --> 02:18:30,000
It looks probably the prince's condition.

2359
02:18:30,450 --> 02:18:32,000
And then you're familiar with him in front of Congress.

2360
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
But more useful than a center.

2361
02:18:35,250 --> 02:18:37,000
How many of these?

2362
02:18:37,400 --> 02:18:40,000
Maybe a little too well, Robert.

2363
02:18:42,550 --> 02:18:44,000
It was six years ago.

2364
02:18:44,950 --> 02:18:46,000
You know, they're truly vindictive.

2365
02:18:46,300 --> 02:18:48,000
Patient to say it's...

2366
02:18:48,300 --> 02:18:50,000
Straws has been perfectly clear that he is neutral.

2367
02:18:50,150 --> 02:18:52,370
Wake up! It is straws!

2368
02:18:52,400 --> 02:18:54,000
It's always been straws and you know it!

2369
02:18:54,050 --> 02:19:05,000
Wake up, you'll fight it.

2370
02:19:05,420 --> 02:19:07,000
It wasn't Nichols or Hoover, one of Truman's guys. It was you.

2371
02:19:07,950 --> 02:19:09,000
You gave the file to Borden. You set him on

2372
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:12,000
Oppenheimer. You convinced him... Borden!

2373
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
Didn't take any convincing.

2374
02:19:16,600 --> 02:19:18,000
Take your time using the entire file.

2375
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
Write up your conclusions. Send them to the FBI.

2376
02:19:22,400 --> 02:19:25,000
The material's obviously extensive, but there's nothing new here.

2377
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Your conclusions will be in.

2378
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:33,000
And they'll have to be answered.

2379
02:19:33,600 --> 02:19:35,000
Hoover passes them to McCarthy.

2380
02:19:35,150 --> 02:19:39,000
Oppenheimer's too slippery for that self-promoting clown.

2381
02:19:39,050 --> 02:19:42,000
I've talked it over with Hoover. Hold McCarthy

2382
02:19:42,020 --> 02:19:45,000
at bay while you do this with the AEC.

2383
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
Trial.

2384
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:53,000
No. No trial. You can't give Oppenheimer a platform. You can't martyr him.

2385
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
We need a systematic destruction of Oppenheimer's credibility

2386
02:19:55,250 --> 02:19:57,000
so we can never again speak on matters of national security.

2387
02:19:57,050 --> 02:19:59,000
Then what?

2388
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:00,000
We'll shut you around. Far from the limelight.

2389
02:20:00,200 --> 02:20:03,000
A simple bureaucratic procedure has cute clearance. It's up for renewal.

2390
02:20:03,050 --> 02:20:07,000
You send your accusations to the FBI.

2391
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
Hoover sends them to the AEC. You're forced to act.

2392
02:20:09,500 --> 02:20:11,000
You write up an indictment.

2393
02:20:14,450 --> 02:20:19,000
But tell Oppenheimer his security

2394
02:20:19,650 --> 02:20:25,000
clearance must not be renewed.

2395
02:20:25,200 --> 02:20:27,000
But offer him the chance to appeal.

2396
02:20:27,650 --> 02:20:29,130
As you can see, Robert, it's not yet signed. May I keep this?

2397
02:20:29,500 --> 02:20:32,000
No.

2398
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:36,000
If you do decide to appeal, don't let this into a copy.

2399
02:20:36,400 --> 02:20:38,000
When he appeals, and trust me, you will, I appoint a board.

2400
02:20:38,700 --> 02:20:40,000
They will, of course, have counted.

2401
02:20:40,750 --> 02:20:42,000
Prosecutor?

2402
02:20:42,720 --> 02:20:45,000
In all of his name.

2403
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,720
Who?

2404
02:20:47,730 --> 02:20:50,000
Roger Rob.

2405
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:51,000
Ouch. Rob will have security

2406
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:57,000
clearance to examine Oppenheimer's file.

2407
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:01,010
As will the great board. Defense counsel will not.

2408
02:21:01,020 --> 02:21:04,000
A closed hearing is so-called derogatory information in your indictment.

2409
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:07,000
No audience, no reporters, no burden of proof.

2410
02:21:08,150 --> 02:21:11,000
No burden of proof.

2411
02:21:11,570 --> 02:21:21,000
We're not convicted.

2412
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:25,000
Just an eye.

2413
02:21:25,500 --> 02:21:30,000
What is it you said?

2414
02:21:30,550 --> 02:21:32,000
This is just how the game is played.

2415
02:21:32,350 --> 02:21:36,000
Well, forgive my naivete.

2416
02:21:36,300 --> 02:21:38,000
Amateurs, you seek the sun, get eaten.

2417
02:21:38,150 --> 02:21:41,000
Power stays in the shadows.

2418
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:42,000
But, sir, you're out of the shadows now.

2419
02:21:43,450 --> 02:21:46,000
Yeah, that's why this has to work.

2420
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:51,000
Well, tell her she's testifying this morning.

2421
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:54,000
That'll help.

2422
02:21:54,050 --> 02:21:56,000
And then Hill is in the afternoon.

2423
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:57,000
Hill is gonna help us too.

2424
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:58,000
As you can see, Robert, it's not your side.

2425
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:59,000
May I keep this?

2426
02:21:59,100 --> 02:22:03,000
No.

2427
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:06,000
If you do decide to appeal, then they'll have to send you a copy.

2428
02:22:07,770 --> 02:22:12,000
Take my current driver, my sister.

2429
02:22:12,050 --> 02:22:17,000
I'm not gonna sell my lawyers for this.

2430
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:19,000
Of course not.

2431
02:22:19,100 --> 02:22:22,000
But don't take too long.

2432
02:22:23,150 --> 02:22:25,000
I can't keep Nichols a day.

2433
02:22:25,300 --> 02:22:32,000
I'm sorry it's come to this, Robert.

2434
02:22:33,250 --> 02:22:36,000
I think it's wrong.

2435
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
Nichols wants me to find him so he can get it all on the record.

2436
02:22:39,100 --> 02:22:44,000
Stross wants me to walk away.

2437
02:22:44,300 --> 02:22:47,000
Stross knows that you can't do that.

2438
02:22:47,650 --> 02:22:50,000
You'd be accepting the charges.

2439
02:22:50,420 --> 02:22:52,000
You'll lose your job.

2440
02:22:52,450 --> 02:22:57,000
You will lose your reputation.

2441
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:58,000
We'll lose our house!

2442
02:22:58,100 --> 02:23:01,000
Robert, we have to fight.

2443
02:23:01,250 --> 02:23:03,000
As an AC Council, I can't represent you.

2444
02:23:04,870 --> 02:23:08,000
I'll call Lloyd Garrison.

2445
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:09,000
Oh, he's got the best.

2446
02:23:09,150 --> 02:23:11,000
But I have to warn you.

2447
02:23:12,100 --> 02:23:18,000
This won't be a fair fight.

2448
02:23:19,270 --> 02:23:24,000
During your interview with Boris Pash in 1943, did you refer to microfilm?

2449
02:23:24,050 --> 02:23:30,000
No.

2450
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:31,000
Tap 11.

2451
02:23:31,720 --> 02:23:33,000
Thanks for my paragraph.

2452
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
Have you never said man of the consulate and expert in the use of microfilm?

2453
02:23:35,500 --> 02:23:43,000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2454
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
I would like to know what document Mr. Robb is

2455
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:01,000
quoting from and if we might be furnished with a copy.

2456
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
The document is classified, Mr. Garrison.

2457
02:24:03,050 --> 02:24:06,000
I think we should get back to first-hand information.

2458
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:09,000
It's his first-hand.

2459
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:10,000
How so, Roger?

2460
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
There was a recording at the interview.

2461
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:13,000
You let my client sit here and potentially perjure

2462
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
himself, and all this time you had a recording?

2463
02:24:18,850 --> 02:24:20,450
Nobody told your client to

2464
02:24:21,400 --> 02:24:22,000
misrepresent his former answer.

2465
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
It was 12 years ago. Can we hear this recording?

2466
02:24:24,200 --> 02:24:27,000
You don't have the clearance, Mr. Garrison.

2467
02:24:29,150 --> 02:24:30,230
You were giving it to some front-cut.

2468
02:24:30,850 --> 02:24:35,000
Please, please. Is this proceeding interested in entrapment or in truth?

2469
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:36,000
If it's truth, where's the disclosure? Where's the witness list?

2470
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:37,000
Mr. Garris, this isn't a trial because you are

2471
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:38,000
well aware. Evidentiary rules do not apply.

2472
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:42,000
We are dealing with national security.

2473
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:43,000
Yes, sir. With all due respect, I

2474
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:44,840
fail to see how national security

2475
02:24:44,850 --> 02:24:47,040
prevents the prosecution from providing us with a list of witnesses.

2476
02:24:47,100 --> 02:24:49,000
Joanne, you have my words.

2477
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
She's either from a transcript or not accepted.

2478
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:52,000
I've already explained how

2479
02:24:52,250 --> 02:24:54,000
I made a recoccan-full story.

2480
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
Then why would anyone make up such an elaborate story?

2481
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:03,140
Because I was an idiot.

2482
02:25:03,150 --> 02:25:08,000
Why lie?

2483
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:11,000
Well, clearly with the intention of not revealing who the intermediary was.

2484
02:25:11,220 --> 02:25:14,000
Your friend, Paquon Chanaali, here the commist.

2485
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
He's still your friend?

2486
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
Yes.

2487
02:25:18,070 --> 02:25:22,000
Dr. Rami, thank you for coming.

2488
02:25:22,650 --> 02:25:26,000
Now, how has the prosecution has come?

2489
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,570
Tell her, obviously, they passed the laws.

2490
02:25:28,580 --> 02:25:31,000
What did he say?

2491
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
He wasn't going down to them.

2492
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:36,950
But Frost told him that you and Ruth Dohmen have been having an affair for years.

2493
02:25:36,970 --> 02:25:41,000
The whole time he looked at them in Pasadena, he

2494
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
convinced Lawrence that Richard died of a broken heart.

2495
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Mr. Surd, what's the heart?

2496
02:25:46,120 --> 02:25:49,000
A broken heart.

2497
02:25:49,050 --> 02:25:52,000
Richard never found out.

2498
02:25:52,050 --> 02:25:54,000
As long as it's gonna testify.

2499
02:25:54,200 --> 02:25:56,000
I don't know.

2500
02:25:56,150 --> 02:26:00,000
Dr. Rabi, what governmental positions do you currently hold?

2501
02:26:00,470 --> 02:26:03,000
I'm the chairman of the General Advisory

2502
02:26:03,450 --> 02:26:05,000
Committee to the EIC, succeeding Dr. Oppenheimer.

2503
02:26:05,150 --> 02:26:07,000
And how long have you

2504
02:26:08,670 --> 02:26:11,000
known Dr. Oppenheimer?

2505
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
Since 1928, I know him quite well.

2506
02:26:13,070 --> 02:26:18,000
Well enough to speak to the bearing of his loyalty and character.

2507
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:19,000
Dr. Oppenheimer is a man of upstanding character.

2508
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
And he is loyal to the

2509
02:26:21,100 --> 02:26:27,000
United States, to his

2510
02:26:27,650 --> 02:26:30,130
friends, to the institutions at which he is part.

2511
02:26:30,140 --> 02:26:33,000
Eat.

2512
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
Who's that?

2513
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
Nothing to worry about.

2514
02:26:37,400 --> 02:26:39,000
After the Russian A-bomb test, Dr. Lawrence came to see you about the hydrogen bomb.

2515
02:26:39,800 --> 02:26:41,000
You'd be better off asking him.

2516
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:43,000
What?

2517
02:26:43,400 --> 02:26:48,000
What would you intend to?

2518
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,680
Would you say that Dr. Oppenheimer

2519
02:26:50,690 --> 02:26:54,000
was unalterably opposed to the H-bomb?

2520
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
No, he thought that a fusion program would come at

2521
02:26:56,850 --> 02:27:01,000
the expense of our off-the-good fission program.

2522
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:05,000
But that proved not to be the case.

2523
02:27:05,150 --> 02:27:09,000
In the event both could be done.

2524
02:27:09,300 --> 02:27:12,450
Suppose that this board did not feel satisfied that in his

2525
02:27:12,470 --> 02:27:16,000
testimony here, Dr. Oppenheimer had been wholly truthful.

2526
02:27:17,150 --> 02:27:18,150
What would you say whether or not he should be cleared?

2527
02:27:23,800 --> 02:27:38,000
Why go through all this against the man who

2528
02:27:38,050 --> 02:27:39,000
has accomplished with Dr. Oppenheimer's hands?

2529
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:47,000
Look at his record.

2530
02:27:47,600 --> 02:27:49,000
We have an A-bomb and all series of it.

2531
02:27:49,100 --> 02:27:50,000
We have all series of super bombs.

2532
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:51,000
What more do you want?

2533
02:27:51,150 --> 02:27:55,000
My mates.

2534
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:58,050
But I've known Secretary Stoltz for many years, and

2535
02:27:58,060 --> 02:28:01,000
I feel the necessity to express the warm support.

2536
02:28:01,100 --> 02:28:03,000
For science and scientists, Louis de Chon.

2537
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:05,000
But right now, unless there's any... Senator, I'd like to once again request that

2538
02:28:05,700 --> 02:28:08,860
we're furnished with a list of witnesses.

2539
02:28:08,870 --> 02:28:12,000
And I will remind the nominee that we don't

2540
02:28:12,450 --> 02:28:14,000
always have that information in advance.

2541
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,400
We do know that Dr. Hill will be here after lunch.

2542
02:28:16,410 --> 02:28:19,000
Mr. Chairman, our next scheduled witness,

2543
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:20,000
Dr. Lawrence, has apparently come down with colitis.

2544
02:28:20,900 --> 02:28:23,000
So we're proceeding with William Borden instead.

2545
02:28:23,100 --> 02:28:24,000
Mr. Borden, please take a seat.

2546
02:28:24,050 --> 02:28:26,000
Mr. Borden, hearing your investigation into

2547
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:27,000
Dr. Oppenheimer, did you reach certain conclusions?

2548
02:28:28,150 --> 02:28:31,120
I did.

2549
02:28:31,130 --> 02:28:34,000
And did there come a time when you expressed those conclusions in

2550
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:37,000
a letter to Mr. J. Gopover, the Federal Bureau of Investigation?

2551
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:43,090
That is correct.

2552
02:28:43,100 --> 02:28:46,000
Prior to the writing of the letter, did you discuss the writing of

2553
02:28:46,420 --> 02:28:50,000
the letter with anybody attached to the Atomic Energy Commission?

2554
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:53,000
I did not.

2555
02:28:53,250 --> 02:28:55,770
I did not.

2556
02:28:55,780 --> 02:28:59,000
You actually did recall the letter when in front of me.

2557
02:29:02,150 --> 02:29:05,000
Would you please be so kind as to me if so?

2558
02:29:05,070 --> 02:29:09,000
Dear Mr. Hoover, the purpose of this letter...

2559
02:29:10,400 --> 02:29:13,400
I'm sorry, I'm sorry if I could have...

2560
02:29:13,410 --> 02:29:17,000
What is the purpose of the delay?

2561
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:18,000
You're simply going to read the letter.

2562
02:29:18,300 --> 02:29:21,160
Mr. Chairman, this is the first I've seen of this letter.

2563
02:29:21,170 --> 02:29:24,000
And I see statements here, at least one of a kind, that I

2564
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:25,000
don't think anyone would like to see go into the record.

2565
02:29:25,200 --> 02:29:27,600
These are accusations

2566
02:29:27,610 --> 02:29:30,000
that have not previously been

2567
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:31,000
made, that are not part of the indictment from Nichols.

2568
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:32,000
These are accusations of a kind that I don't think belong here.

2569
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,200
The witness wrote this letter on his own initiative,

2570
02:29:34,450 --> 02:29:37,000
laying out evidence that has

2571
02:29:37,600 --> 02:29:40,000
already been before the board.

2572
02:29:40,120 --> 02:29:42,000
His conclusions are valid testimony, just like the positive

2573
02:29:42,050 --> 02:29:46,000
conclusions of friends of Dr. Oppenheimer. It cuts both ways.

2574
02:29:46,300 --> 02:29:49,000
How long has counsel been in possession of this letter?

2575
02:29:49,800 --> 02:29:52,410
I don't think I should be subject to cross-examination by you, Mr. Garrison.

2576
02:29:52,420 --> 02:29:55,000
Mr. Garrison, given that we're on the board and have all read

2577
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,390
the letter, wouldn't it be

2578
02:29:57,400 --> 02:30:00,000
better to have it in the record?

2579
02:30:00,150 --> 02:30:03,000
Let's proceed.

2580
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:04,870
Dear Mr. Hoover, The purpose of

2581
02:30:04,880 --> 02:30:07,020
this letter is to state my opinion, based

2582
02:30:07,050 --> 02:30:09,960
upon years of study of the

2583
02:30:09,970 --> 02:30:13,000
available classified evidence,

2584
02:30:13,650 --> 02:30:16,000
that more probably than not, J. Robert Oppenheimer is an agent of the Soviet Union.

2585
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:20,000
The following conclusions are justified.

2586
02:30:20,320 --> 02:30:22,770
One, between 1929 and 1942, more probably than not, J. Robert Oppenheimer was a

2587
02:30:22,780 --> 02:30:25,160
sufficiently hardened communist that he volunteered information to the Soviets.

2588
02:30:25,800 --> 02:30:27,000
Two, more probably than not, he has since been functioning as an espionage agent.

2589
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:34,450
Three, more probably than not, he has since acted under a

2590
02:30:34,470 --> 02:30:38,000
Soviet directive influencing the United States military policy.

2591
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:45,000
I'm sorry, Robert.

2592
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:48,000
Is anyone else ever going to tell the truth about what's happening here?

2593
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:52,980
We will now hear from Dr. David Hill.

2594
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:58,000
Dr. Hill, would you care to make a statement?

2595
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:04,000
Thank you.

2596
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:08,260
I have been asked to testify about Louis Straws, a man who

2597
02:31:08,270 --> 02:31:13,000
has given years of service in high positions of government

2598
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:14,000
and who is known to be earnest,

2599
02:31:14,220 --> 02:31:20,000
hardworking and intelligent.

2600
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:23,000
The views I have to express are my own, but I

2601
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:36,000
believe that much I have to say will help to indicate

2602
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:39,000
why most of the scientists in this country would prefer to see Mr. Straws completely out of government.

2603
02:31:39,900 --> 02:31:43,930
You're referring to the hostility of certain scientists directed toward Mr. Straws

2604
02:31:43,950 --> 02:31:48,000
because of his commitment to security as demonstrated in the Oppenheimer affair?

2605
02:31:48,050 --> 02:31:54,000
No. Because of the personal vindictiveness he demonstrated against Dr. Oppenheimer.

2606
02:31:55,200 --> 02:32:02,440
Order! Order!

2607
02:32:02,450 --> 02:32:10,000
It appears the most scientists around this country, Robert Oppenheimer, is now

2608
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:16,560
being pilloried and put through an ordeal because he expressed his honest opinions.

2609
02:32:16,580 --> 02:32:23,000
Dr. Bush, I thought I was performing a service to my country when nearing this case.

2610
02:32:24,300 --> 02:32:32,000
No board in this country should sit in judgment

2611
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:35,000
of a man because he expressed his strong opinions.

2612
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:41,280
If you want to try that case, you should try me.

2613
02:32:41,290 --> 02:32:48,000
Excuse me, gentlemen, if I become stirred, but I am.

2614
02:32:48,020 --> 02:32:52,000
Dr. Hill, we've already heard that Mr. Straws did not bring the

2615
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:55,380
charges or participate in the

2616
02:32:55,390 --> 02:32:59,000
hearings against Dr. Oppenheimer.

2617
02:32:59,100 --> 02:33:02,880
The Oppenheimer matter

2618
02:33:02,890 --> 02:33:07,000
was initiated and carried

2619
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:10,980
through, largely through the animus of Louis Straws.

2620
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:15,000
Oppenheimer made men speak out of Straws' position on the shipments of

2621
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:18,340
isotopes to Norway and Straws never forgave him this public humiliation.

2622
02:33:18,360 --> 02:33:22,000
Another controversy between them centered around their differences

2623
02:33:22,400 --> 02:33:27,120
in judgment on how the age-old would contribute to national security.

2624
02:33:27,130 --> 02:33:32,000
Straws turned to the personal security system

2625
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,920
in order to destroy Oppenheimer's effectiveness.

2626
02:33:35,930 --> 02:33:39,000
And Straws was able to find a few ambitious men who also disagreed with

2627
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,890
Oppenheimer's positions and envied him his prestige in government circles.

2628
02:33:41,900 --> 02:33:45,000
I've always assumed and still assume that he's loyal to the United States.

2629
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:49,390
I believe this and I shall leave it until I see very conclusive truth to the others.

2630
02:33:49,400 --> 02:33:54,000
Do you or do you not believe that Dr. Oppenheimer is a security risk?

2631
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:59,000
In a great number of cases I've seen Dr. Oppenheimer act

2632
02:33:59,600 --> 02:34:04,000
in a way which was to me exceedingly hard to understand.

2633
02:34:04,250 --> 02:34:08,000
I thoroughly disagree with him in numerous issues and his

2634
02:34:11,850 --> 02:34:14,910
actions frankly appear to me confused and complicated.

2635
02:34:14,920 --> 02:34:18,000
To this extent, I feel I want

2636
02:34:18,820 --> 02:34:21,470
to see the vital interests of this

2637
02:34:21,480 --> 02:34:24,000
country in hands which I understand better and therefore trust more.

2638
02:34:24,720 --> 02:34:28,720
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

2639
02:34:28,730 --> 02:34:33,000
Sorry.

2640
02:34:34,450 --> 02:34:36,000
You shook his fucking hand?

2641
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:41,000
Oh, I could have spit in his face.

2642
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:45,000
I'm not sure the border would have appreciated that.

2643
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:48,000
Isn't that gentlemanly enough for you? I think

2644
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,080
you're all being too goddamn gentlemanly.

2645
02:34:50,300 --> 02:34:52,770
Gray must see what Rob is doing. Why doesn't it just shut him down?

2646
02:34:52,780 --> 02:34:55,000
And you shaking towers again?

2647
02:34:55,050 --> 02:34:59,000
You need to stop playing the martyr.

2648
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
Under the current AEC guidelines, would you clear Dr. Oppenheimer today?

2649
02:35:02,600 --> 02:35:05,000
Under my interpretation of the Atomic Energy Act, which

2650
02:35:06,200 --> 02:35:11,000
did not exist when I hired Dr. Oppenheimer in 1942,

2651
02:35:16,950 --> 02:35:21,630
I would not clear him today if I were on the Commission.

2652
02:35:21,640 --> 02:35:26,000
Good. Thank you, General. That is all. But I don't

2653
02:35:27,500 --> 02:35:33,000
think I'd clear any of those guys. That's all.

2654
02:35:33,200 --> 02:35:35,680
Dr. Oppenheimer had no responsibility in the

2655
02:35:35,700 --> 02:35:38,000
selection or the clearance of class views, did he?

2656
02:35:41,350 --> 02:35:43,510
No. None at all.

2657
02:35:43,520 --> 02:35:46,000
And you wouldn't want to leave this board with any suggestion today that you're

2658
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:47,000
questioning his basic loyalty to the United States in the operation of Los Alamos?

2659
02:35:47,650 --> 02:35:51,240
By no means. I hope I didn't lead anyone to believe otherwise for an instant.

2660
02:35:51,250 --> 02:35:55,000
Thank you, General.

2661
02:35:55,100 --> 02:36:00,000
You shouldn't keep them waiting.

2662
02:36:01,150 --> 02:36:03,000
She'll be here.

2663
02:36:07,650 --> 02:36:22,000
Do you even want her here?

2664
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:23,000
Would her fool or an adolescent presume to know someone

2665
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
else's relationship? And you neither have a lawyer.

2666
02:36:30,550 --> 02:36:32,750
Kitty and I are grown-ups. We've walked through fire together. You will do fine.

2667
02:36:32,770 --> 02:36:34,830
Will you describe your views on Communism as pro-anti-neutral?

2668
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:42,000
Very strongly against. I have nothing to do with Communism since 1936,

2669
02:36:43,350 --> 02:36:47,000
since before I met Robert.

2670
02:36:48,600 --> 02:36:53,000
That's all.

2671
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
The record demonstrates that Oppenheimer was not interrogated

2672
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
by impartial and disinterested counsel for the Grey Board.

2673
02:36:59,900 --> 02:37:02,500
He was interrogated by a prosecutor who used all

2674
02:37:02,510 --> 02:37:05,000
the tricks of a rather ingenious legal background.

2675
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,920
You are charging now that the Grey Board permitted a prosecution.

2676
02:37:07,930 --> 02:37:11,000
If I were on the Grey Board, I would have protested against the

2677
02:37:11,050 --> 02:37:15,000
tactics of the man who served, in fact, as the prosecuting counsel.

2678
02:37:15,820 --> 02:37:19,290
A man appointed not by the Board, but by Louis Straus.

2679
02:37:19,300 --> 02:37:23,000
Who was this?

2680
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:27,000
I'm sorry?

2681
02:37:30,100 --> 02:37:31,000
Who was this?

2682
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
Roger Roberts.

2683
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
Mrs. Oppenheimer.

2684
02:37:36,050 --> 02:37:37,050
Did you have a Communist Party membership card?

2685
02:37:37,900 --> 02:37:39,000
I'm... I'm not sure.

2686
02:37:43,750 --> 02:37:46,000
Not sure.

2687
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:49,000
Well.

2688
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:50,000
Well?

2689
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:51,000
I mean, presumably the act of joining the party

2690
02:37:53,700 --> 02:37:57,000
required sending some money and receiving a card, no?

2691
02:37:58,450 --> 02:38:05,270
Yeah.

2692
02:38:05,280 --> 02:38:13,000
Sorry.

2693
02:38:13,300 --> 02:38:17,000
Yes?

2694
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:20,000
It's just it was all so very long ago.

2695
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:25,000
Mr. Robert wasn't able to do it long enough to have forgotten.

2696
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
Not really.

2697
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:32,000
Would you return the card or rip it up?

2698
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
The card whose existence I've forgotten.

2699
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:35,000
The Communist Party membership card.

2700
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:36,120
Having the slightest idea.

2701
02:38:36,150 --> 02:38:38,000
Can a distinction be made between Soviet Communism and Communism?

2702
02:38:38,050 --> 02:38:39,000
Well, in the days when I was a member, I thought there were definitely two things.

2703
02:38:39,050 --> 02:38:41,000
I thought that the Communist Party of the United

2704
02:38:44,350 --> 02:38:48,000
States was concerned with our domestic problems.

2705
02:38:49,250 --> 02:38:51,270
I now no longer believe this.

2706
02:38:51,300 --> 02:38:53,630
They've all things linked together and spread all over the world.

2707
02:38:53,650 --> 02:38:56,000
And I've believed this since I left the party.

2708
02:38:56,050 --> 02:38:58,000
Sixteen years ago.

2709
02:38:58,700 --> 02:39:01,000
Oh, seventeen years ago.

2710
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
My mistake.

2711
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
But you... Sorry, eighteen.

2712
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:06,000
Eighteen years ago.

2713
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:07,000
Are you familiar with the

2714
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
fact your husband was making

2715
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:12,000
contributions to the Spanish Civil War's latest national anthem?

2716
02:39:13,650 --> 02:39:15,170
The Civil War's latest 1942.

2717
02:39:15,180 --> 02:39:17,000
I knew that Robert gave money from time to time.

2718
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
Did you know this money was going into Communist Party channels?

2719
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
Don't you mean through?

2720
02:39:21,120 --> 02:39:24,000
Pardon?

2721
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:25,000
Thank you. It means through Communist Party channels, don't you?

2722
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:26,000
Yes.

2723
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:29,000
Yes.

2724
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:30,000
Yes.

2725
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:31,000
Then would it be fair to say that this meant that by 1942 your

2726
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:32,000
husband did not stop having anything to do with the Communist Party?

2727
02:39:32,070 --> 02:39:35,360
You don't have to answer that yes or no. You can answer that any way you wish.

2728
02:39:35,370 --> 02:39:39,000
I know that. Thank you.

2729
02:39:39,500 --> 02:39:42,270
It's your question. It's not properly phrased.

2730
02:39:42,300 --> 02:39:44,000
Do you understand what I'm getting at?

2731
02:39:44,100 --> 02:39:47,000
I do.

2732
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:48,070
Why don't you answer that?

2733
02:39:48,100 --> 02:39:49,000
Because I don't like your phrase having anything to do with the Communist

2734
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:50,000
Party because Robert never had anything to do with the Communist Party as such.

2735
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:53,350
I know he gave money to Spanish refugees. I know he

2736
02:39:53,360 --> 02:39:57,000
took an intellectual interest in Communist ideas.

2737
02:39:57,350 --> 02:40:00,210
The two types of Communists. Intellectual

2738
02:40:00,230 --> 02:40:03,000
Communists and your plain old regular Communist.

2739
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,290
Well, I couldn't answer that one.

2740
02:40:05,300 --> 02:40:08,000
I couldn't either.

2741
02:40:08,400 --> 02:40:11,000
Robert, you can't win this thing. It's a kangaroo court with

2742
02:40:11,100 --> 02:40:13,000
a predetermined outcome. I put yourself through more of it.

2743
02:40:15,250 --> 02:40:21,160
I had my reasons.

2744
02:40:21,170 --> 02:40:27,000
He has that point.

2745
02:40:27,600 --> 02:40:29,000
I'm not sure you understand, Albert.

2746
02:40:30,550 --> 02:40:39,000
No.

2747
02:40:39,550 --> 02:40:42,000
I left my country. Never talk with her.

2748
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:43,000
You served your country well.

2749
02:40:44,050 --> 02:40:46,000
If this is the reward she offers you, then perhaps you should turn your back on her.

2750
02:40:47,500 --> 02:40:49,000
Damn it. I haven't been off this country.

2751
02:40:49,900 --> 02:40:55,000
Then tell them to go to hell.

2752
02:40:55,250 --> 02:40:58,000
Interesting, Leon. There's no longer an information hearing. It's now a trial.

2753
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:01,000
About a trial?

2754
02:41:02,250 --> 02:41:07,000
It's not good he's telling

2755
02:41:07,350 --> 02:41:09,000
everyone you initiated the hearings.

2756
02:41:10,200 --> 02:41:13,000
He can't prove a goddamn thing. He certainly

2757
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:19,000
can't prove that I gave file court.

2758
02:41:19,300 --> 02:41:22,000
We're not in court, sir.

2759
02:41:22,050 --> 02:41:24,000
There's no burden of proof.

2760
02:41:25,450 --> 02:41:30,000
Right. They're not convicted.

2761
02:41:30,100 --> 02:41:33,000
Just denying. Why would he all come

2762
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,750
here to tear me down? What's the angle?

2763
02:41:35,760 --> 02:41:39,000
Do people need a reason to do the right thing as he sees it?

2764
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:45,000
I told you. Up and under, the court is going to

2765
02:41:45,700 --> 02:41:49,000
science this against me, right from that first meeting.

2766
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:52,250
I don't know. But Oppenheimer said to him that day would last time even meet my eye.

2767
02:41:52,260 --> 02:41:55,000
Oppenheimer knows how to manipulate his own.

2768
02:41:55,350 --> 02:41:58,000
He levels elbows. He prayed on the night of day as scientists

2769
02:41:58,150 --> 02:42:00,920
thought they'd get a say in how he used their work.

2770
02:42:00,930 --> 02:42:04,000
They'll never think he was that naive himself.

2771
02:42:05,250 --> 02:42:08,000
Doctor, during your work on the hydrogen

2772
02:42:08,500 --> 02:42:12,000
bomb, were you deterred by any moral qualms?

2773
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
Yes, of course. But you still got on with your work, didn't you?

2774
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,440
Yes, because this was worth exploration and was not the preparation of a weapon.

2775
02:42:16,450 --> 02:42:19,000
You mean it was more of an academic excursion?

2776
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:22,000
No, it was not an academic thing. It was that you could

2777
02:42:22,200 --> 02:42:24,000
build a hydrogen bomb. It was a matter of life and death.

2778
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
By 1942, you were actively pushing the development of the hydrogen bomb.

2779
02:42:26,200 --> 02:42:28,560
Were you pushing the stuff that I'm working on?

2780
02:42:28,570 --> 02:42:31,000
Supporting it and working on it. Yes.

2781
02:42:31,220 --> 02:42:33,640
When did these moral qualms become so strong that you

2782
02:42:33,660 --> 02:42:36,000
actively opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb?

2783
02:42:36,150 --> 02:42:38,380
When it was suggested that it be the policy of the

2784
02:42:38,390 --> 02:42:41,000
United States to make these things at all costs,

2785
02:42:41,050 --> 02:42:45,000
without regard to the balance between these

2786
02:42:45,150 --> 02:42:48,000
weapons and atomic weapons as part of our arsenal.

2787
02:42:48,050 --> 02:42:50,000
What moral qualms have to do with that?

2788
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:53,040
What moral qualms have to do with it?

2789
02:42:53,050 --> 02:42:56,000
Yes. Oppenheimer wanted to own the atomic bomb.

2790
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:59,000
He wanted to be the man who moved the earth. He talks

2791
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:03,000
about putting the nuclear chain back in the bottle.

2792
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:09,000
Well, I'm here to tell you that I know one.

2793
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:14,000
J. Robert Oppenheimer, if he could do it all over, he'd do it all the same.

2794
02:43:14,150 --> 02:43:18,000
You know he's never once said that he regrets Hiroshima. He'd do it all over. Why?

2795
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,090
Because it means him the most important man who ever lived.

2796
02:43:20,100 --> 02:43:22,000
Well, we freely used the atomic bomb.

2797
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:23,000
In fact, Dr. Yew resisted in selecting the target

2798
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:26,000
to drop the atomic bomb on Japan, didn't he?

2799
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:29,000
Yes.

2800
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:32,000
Well, then you knew, did you know that by dropping that atomic bomb on the target,

2801
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:35,000
you selected the thousands of civilians with the killer injured. Is that correct?

2802
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:36,000
Yes. Not as many as turned out.

2803
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:39,000
Oh. How many were killed in it?

2804
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
Seventy thousand.

2805
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:44,000
Seventy thousand of both Hiroshima and... One hundred and ten thousand of both.

2806
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:47,000
On the day of each bombing.

2807
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
Yes. One of the weeks and years of follow.

2808
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:50,000
It has been put at somewhere between fifty and one hundred thousand.

2809
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
Two hundred and twenty thousand dead at least.

2810
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
Yes.

2811
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:58,000
And moral scoop was about that.

2812
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
Terrible ones.

2813
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
But did you testify to me or that the bombing of Hiroshima was very successful?

2814
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:32,000
Technically successful.

2815
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:33,000
Technically it was very successful.

2816
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:34,960
And it is also next to a We cannot go down this road even as human beings.

2817
02:44:34,970 --> 02:44:38,000
We act.

2818
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:39,000
Would you have been opposed to the dropping

2819
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:40,910
of a thermal nuclear weapon on Japan because of moral scruples?

2820
02:44:40,930 --> 02:44:43,000
You said I would say.

2821
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
If you were opposed to dropping an atomic

2822
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
bomb on Hiroshima because of moral scruples.

2823
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:51,000
We set forth our... I know. Yew, yew, yew.

2824
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:54,000
I asked for... I see you.

2825
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
I should have forced our arguments against dropping it, but I did not endorse them.

2826
02:44:56,000 --> 02:45:00,000
You mean after working night and day for three years building the bomb.

2827
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
You then argued against the instrument.

2828
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:03,000
I was asked by the secretary of war what the views of scientists were.

2829
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
I gave them the views against and the views for.

2830
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:06,000
You supported the job.

2831
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:07,000
You didn't have a problem with your plan.

2832
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
You supported it.

2833
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:10,000
I didn't mean support.

2834
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
Well you helped pick the target, didn't you?

2835
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
I did my job.

2836
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:17,000
I was not in a policy making position at Los Alamos.

2837
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
I would have done anything I was asking for.

2838
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:24,000
Well then you wouldn't took the H-bomb too, wouldn't you?

2839
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:27,000
I didn't ask you that, Doctor.

2840
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:28,000
And the GAC reported you go off after the show and the target just said.

2841
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:32,000
A super bomb should never be built.

2842
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:35,000
What we meant, what I meant.

2843
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:38,000
I thought you knew what I meant too.

2844
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:42,000
Wouldn't the Russians do anything to increase their strength?

2845
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:45,000
If we did it, they would have to do it.

2846
02:45:45,850 --> 02:45:50,000
Our efforts would only fuel their efforts just as it had with the atomic bomb.

2847
02:45:54,350 --> 02:45:58,770
Just as it had with the atomic bomb exactly.

2848
02:45:58,780 --> 02:46:04,000
No moral school was in 1945 plenty in 1949.

2849
02:46:10,900 --> 02:46:19,000
Doctor Oppenheimer, when did your strong moral

2850
02:46:19,650 --> 02:46:25,000
convictions develop with respect to the hydrogen bomb?

2851
02:46:25,150 --> 02:46:34,000
When it became clear to me that we would tend to use any weapon we had,

2852
02:46:34,500 --> 02:46:37,000
J. Robert Oppenheimer the martyr, I gave him exactly what he wanted.

2853
02:46:37,250 --> 02:46:41,000
To be remembered for Trinity, not Hiroshima, not Nagasaki.

2854
02:46:41,800 --> 02:46:43,000
You should be thanking me.

2855
02:46:43,550 --> 02:46:46,290
Well, it is not.

2856
02:46:46,300 --> 02:46:49,000
Do we still have enough votes?

2857
02:46:49,400 --> 02:46:52,000
Or is the crowning moment in my career about to

2858
02:46:52,250 --> 02:46:55,000
become the most public humiliation in my life?

2859
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:59,190
Full sentence about to go.

2860
02:46:59,200 --> 02:47:03,000
Don't scrape through. Great, then gather the fucking press.

2861
02:47:03,100 --> 02:47:09,000
Doctor J. Robert Oppenheimer, this board, having her testimony

2862
02:47:09,550 --> 02:47:13,600
from you and many of your current and former colleagues,

2863
02:47:13,620 --> 02:47:18,000
has come to the unanimous conclusion that you are a loyal citizen.

2864
02:47:18,400 --> 02:47:23,090
However, in the light of your continuing associations

2865
02:47:23,100 --> 02:47:28,000
and disregard for the security apparatus of this country,

2866
02:47:28,600 --> 02:47:34,000
together with your somewhat disturbing conduct on the hydrogen bomb program

2867
02:47:34,600 --> 02:47:37,470
and the incredible lack of candor and certain of your responses to this board,

2868
02:47:37,490 --> 02:47:41,000
we have voted two to one to deny the renewal of your security clearance.

2869
02:47:41,550 --> 02:47:44,000
A full written opinion with a dissent from

2870
02:47:46,550 --> 02:47:49,000
Mr. Evans will be issued to the AEC in coming days.

2871
02:47:53,200 --> 02:47:55,000
That is all.

2872
02:47:55,200 --> 02:47:57,000
Board member.

2873
02:47:57,000 --> 02:48:02,000
Robert.

2874
02:48:03,650 --> 02:48:06,000
Robert.

2875
02:48:06,870 --> 02:48:21,000
Don't tell.

2876
02:48:21,500 --> 02:48:26,000
Don't take him to sheets.

2877
02:48:30,250 --> 02:48:33,000
Is it official?

2878
02:48:33,400 --> 02:48:35,000
Well, there were a couple of unexpected holdouts.

2879
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
I'm denied. Yeah?

2880
02:48:42,750 --> 02:48:44,000
I'm afraid so, sir.

2881
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:47,120
All right.

2882
02:48:47,140 --> 02:48:51,000
Who were the holdouts?

2883
02:48:51,200 --> 02:48:54,000
There were three, led by the junior senator from

2884
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
Massachusetts, and a guy trying to make a name for himself.

2885
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:57,000
Didn't like what you did to Oppenheimer.

2886
02:48:57,600 --> 02:48:59,000
What's his name?

2887
02:49:02,700 --> 02:49:04,760
Kennedy.

2888
02:49:04,770 --> 02:49:07,000
John F. Kennedy.

2889
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:10,000
Did you think that if you let them talk or

2890
02:49:10,950 --> 02:49:13,000
infest you, that the world would forgive you?

2891
02:49:13,800 --> 02:49:20,000
It won't.

2892
02:49:27,750 --> 02:49:29,000
I'll see.

2893
02:49:33,150 --> 02:49:41,000
I'm sorry.

2894
02:49:41,250 --> 02:49:43,000
Please.

2895
02:49:43,300 --> 02:49:45,000
You told me I'd be okay.

2896
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:49,000
Well, I didn't have all the facts, did I?

2897
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
Here's the fact.

2898
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
President Eisenhower pinned the Medal of Freedom on my chest last year,

2899
02:49:53,200 --> 02:49:55,000
because I've always done what's right for this country.

2900
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:58,000
They don't want me in the cabinet room.

2901
02:49:58,100 --> 02:50:00,000
Well, that's... that's fine.

2902
02:50:00,100 --> 02:50:05,000
Maybe they should just invite Oppenheimer instead.

2903
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:08,000
Maybe they will.

2904
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
I told you, you turned the scientists against me one by one, starting with Einstein.

2905
02:50:10,850 --> 02:50:14,000
I told you about that, Einstein. I said by the pond.

2906
02:50:14,010 --> 02:50:17,000
You did, but you know, sir,

2907
02:50:17,150 --> 02:50:20,000
nobody really knows what they said to each other that

2908
02:50:20,250 --> 02:50:22,000
it's impossible they didn't talk about you at all.

2909
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:25,000
It's impossible they spoke about something that...

2910
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:40,000
More important than I know.

2911
02:50:40,400 --> 02:50:47,000
Thank you.

2912
02:50:48,150 --> 02:50:54,000
The man of the moment.

2913
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,000
You once held a reception for me. In fact, he gave me an award.

2914
02:50:56,200 --> 02:51:01,000
Yes.

2915
02:51:01,370 --> 02:51:07,000
You all thought that I had lost the ability to understand what had started.

2916
02:51:08,900 --> 02:51:16,000
So the award really wasn't for me. It was for all of you.

2917
02:51:16,700 --> 02:51:21,000
Now it's your turn to deal with the consequences of your achievement.

2918
02:51:22,300 --> 02:51:27,000
And one day, when they punished you enough,

2919
02:51:30,400 --> 02:51:33,000
they'll serve you salmon and potato salad.

2920
02:51:33,250 --> 02:51:36,000
Thanks, peaches.

2921
02:51:37,050 --> 02:51:41,000
If you are made of...

2922
02:51:41,250 --> 02:51:47,000
Oh, Frank. You are happy, I'm happy.

2923
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:53,000
I'll turn the back, tell you all is forgiven.

2924
02:51:54,300 --> 02:52:02,000
Just remember, it won't be for you.

2925
02:52:02,700 --> 02:52:06,000
It will be for them.

2926
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:21,000
Help me.

2927
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:27,000
When I came to you with those calculations,

2928
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:30,000
we thought we might start a chain reaction that would destroy the entire world.

2929
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:33,000
I am in the world.

2930
02:52:34,450 --> 02:52:39,000
What happened?

2931
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:43,000
I believe we did.

2932
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:47,000
I believe we did.

2933
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:51,000
I believe we did.

2934
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:55,000
I believe we did.

2935
02:52:55,000 --> 02:53:23,000
I believe we did.
